# Inspector

The Inspector component has been moved to a separate GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/Inspector

## Usage with DRAW

To use the Inspector plugin in DRAW:

1. Copy the required dynamic library files (.so, .dll) from the Inspector repository to your OCCT installation folder. For example, on Linux, you can copy the files to the `lib` directory in the OCCT installation directory. For windows, you can copy the files to the `bin` directory in the OCCT installation directory.
2. Load the plugin in your DRAW session
