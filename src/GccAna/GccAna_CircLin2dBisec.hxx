//! Describes functions for building bisecting curves between a 2D line and a 2D circle.
//! A bisecting curve between a circle and a line is a curve
//! such that each of its points is at the same distance from
//! the circle and the line. It can be a parabola or a line,
//! depending of the relative position of the line and the
//! circle. The algorithm computes all the elementary curves which are solutions.
//! A CircLin2dBisec object provides a framework for:
//! -   defining the construction of the bisecting curves,
//! -   implementing the construction algorithm, and
//! -   consulting the result.
