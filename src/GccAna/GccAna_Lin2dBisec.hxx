//! Describes functions for building bisecting lines between two 2D lines.
//! A bisecting line between two lines is such that each of its
//! points is at the same distance from the two lines.
//! If the two lines are secant, there are two orthogonal
//! bisecting lines which share the angles made by the two
//! straight lines in two equal parts. If D1 and D2 are the
//! unit vectors of the two straight lines, those of the two
//! bisecting lines are collinear with the following vectors:
//! -   D1 + D2 for the "internal" bisecting line,
//! -   D1 - D2 for the "external" bisecting line.
//! If the two lines are parallel, the (unique) bisecting line is
//! the straight line equidistant from the two straight lines. If
//! the two straight lines are coincident, the algorithm
//! returns the first straight line as the solution.
//! A Lin2dTanObl object provides a framework for:
//! -   defining the construction of the bisecting lines,
//! -   implementing the construction algorithm, and
//! -   consulting the result.
