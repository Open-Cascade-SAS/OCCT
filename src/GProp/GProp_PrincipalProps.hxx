//! A framework to present the principal properties of
//! inertia of a system of which global properties are
//! computed by a GProp_GProps object.
//! There is always a set of axes for which the
//! products of inertia of a geometric system are equal
//! to 0; i.e. the matrix of inertia of the system is
//! diagonal. These axes are the principal axes of
//! inertia. Their origin is coincident with the center of
//! mass of the system. The associated moments are
//! called the principal moments of inertia.
//! This sort of presentation object is created, filled and
//! returned by the function PrincipalProperties for
//! any GProp_GProps object, and can be queried to access the result.
//! Note: The system whose principal properties of
//! inertia are returned by this framework is referred to
//! as the current system. The current system,
//! however, is retained neither by this presentation
//! framework nor by the GProp_GProps object which activates it.

  //! returns the third axis of inertia.
  //! This and the above functions return the first, second or third eigen vector of the
  //! matrix of inertia of the current system.
  //! The first, second and third principal axis of inertia
  //! pass through the center of mass of the current
  //! system. They are respectively parallel to these three eigen vectors.
  //! Note that:
  //! - If the current system has an axis of symmetry, any
  //! axis is an axis of principal inertia if it passes
  //! through the center of mass of the system, and runs
  //! parallel to a linear combination of the two eigen
  //! vectors of the matrix of inertia, corresponding to the
  //! two eigen values which are equal. If the current
  //! system has a center of symmetry, any axis passing
  //! through the center of mass of the system is an axis
  //! of principal inertia. Use the functions
  //! HasSymmetryAxis and HasSymmetryPoint to
  //! check these particular cases, where the returned
  //! eigen vectors define an infinity of principal axis of inertia.
  //! - The Moments function can be used to know which
  //! of the three eigen vectors corresponds to the two
  //! eigen values which are equal.
  //!
  //! if the system has a point of symmetry or an axis of symmetry the
  //! second and the third axis of symmetry are undefined.
