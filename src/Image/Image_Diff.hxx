//! This class compares two images pixel-by-pixel.
//! It uses the following methods to ignore the difference between images:
//!  - Black/White comparison. It makes the images 2-colored before the comparison.
//!  - Equality with tolerance. Colors of two pixels are considered the same if the
//!    difference of their color is less than a tolerance.
//!  - Border filter. The algorithm ignores alone independent pixels,
//!    which are different on both images, ignores the "border effect" -
//!    the difference caused by triangles located at angle about 0 or 90 degrees to the user.
//!
//! Border filter ignores a difference in implementation of
//! anti-aliasing and other effects on boundary of a shape.
//! The triangles of a boundary zone are usually located so that their normals point aside the user
//! (about 90 degree between the normal and the direction to the user's eye).
//! Deflection of the light for such a triangle depends on implementation of the video driver.
//! In order to skip this difference the following algorithm is used:
//!  a) "Different" pixels are grouped and checked on "one-pixel width line".
//!     indeed, the pixels may represent not a line, but any curve.
//!     But the width of this curve should be not more than a pixel.
//!     This group of pixels become a candidate to be ignored because of boundary effect.
//!  b) The group of pixels is checked on belonging to a "shape".
//!     Neighbour pixels are checked from the reference image.
//!     This test confirms a fact that the group of pixels belongs to a shape and
//!     represent a boundary of the shape.
//!     In this case the whole group of pixels is ignored (considered as same).
//!     Otherwise, the group of pixels may represent a geometrical curve in the viewer 3D
//!     and should be considered as "different".
