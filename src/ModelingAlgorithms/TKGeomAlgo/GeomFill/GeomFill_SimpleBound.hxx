  //! Curve is an adapted curve, that is, an object which is an interface between:
  //! -   the services provided by a 3D curve from the package Geom
  //! -   and those required of the curve by the computation
  //! algorithm which uses it.
  //! The adapted curve is created in one of the following ways:
  //! -   First sequence:
  //! Handle(Geom_Curve) myCurve = ... ;
  //! Handle(GeomAdaptor_Curve)
  //! Curve = new
  //! GeomAdaptor_Curve(myCurve);
  //! -   Second sequence:
  //! // Step 1
  //! Handle(Geom_Curve) myCurve = ... ;
  //! GeomAdaptor_Curve Crv (myCurve);
  //! // Step 2
  //! Handle(GeomAdaptor_Curve)
  //! Curve = new
  //! GeomAdaptor_Curve(Crv);
  //! You use the second part of this sequence if you already
  //! have the adapted curve Crv.
  //! The boundary is then constructed with the Curve object:
  //! Standard_Real Tol = ... ;
  //! Standard_Real dummy = 0. ;
  //! myBoundary = GeomFill_SimpleBound
