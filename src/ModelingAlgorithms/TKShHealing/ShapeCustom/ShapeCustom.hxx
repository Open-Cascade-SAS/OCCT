//! (one) geometrical object are provided. The supported
//! modifications are the following:
//! conversion of BSpline and Bezier surfaces to analytical form,
//! conversion of indirect elementary surfaces (with left-handed
//! coordinate systems) into  direct ones,
//! conversion of elementary surfaces to surfaces of revolution,
//! conversion of surface of linear extrusion, revolution, offset
//! surface to bspline,
//! modification of parameterization, degree, number of segments of bspline
//! surfaces,  scale the shape.
