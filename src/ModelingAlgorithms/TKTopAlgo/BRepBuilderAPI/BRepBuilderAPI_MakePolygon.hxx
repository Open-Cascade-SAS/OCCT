//! Describes functions to build polygonal wires. A
//! polygonal wire can be built from any number of points
//! or vertices, and consists of a sequence of connected
//! rectilinear edges.
//! When a point or vertex is added to the  polygon if
//! it is identic  to the previous  point no  edge  is
//! built. The method added can be used to test it.
//! Construction of a Polygonal Wire
//! You can construct:
//! -   a complete polygonal wire by defining all its points
//! or vertices (limited to four), or
//! -   an empty polygonal wire and add its points or
//! vertices in sequence (unlimited number).
//! A MakePolygon object provides a framework for:
//! -   initializing the construction of a polygonal wire,
//! -   adding points or vertices to the polygonal wire under construction, and
//! -   consulting the result.
