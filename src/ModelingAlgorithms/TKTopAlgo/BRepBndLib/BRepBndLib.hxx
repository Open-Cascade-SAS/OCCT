  //! Adds the shape S to the bounding box B.
  //! More precisely are successively added to B:
  //! -   each face of S; the triangulation of the face is used if it exists,
  //! -   then each edge of S which does not belong to a face,
  //! the polygon of the edge is used if it exists
  //! -   and last each vertex of S which does not belong to an edge.
  //! After each elementary operation, the bounding box B is
  //! enlarged by the tolerance value of the relative sub-shape.
  //! When working with the triangulation of a face this value of
  //! enlargement is the sum of the triangulation deflection and
  //! the face tolerance. When working with the
  //! polygon of an edge this value of enlargement is
  //! the sum of the polygon deflection and the edge tolerance.
  //! Warning
  //! -   This algorithm is time consuming if triangulation has not
  //! been inserted inside the data structure of the shape S.
  //! -   The resulting bounding box may be somewhat larger than the object.

  //! Adds the shape S to the bounding box B.
  //! This is a quick algorithm but only works if the shape S is
  //! composed of polygonal planar faces, as is the case if S is
  //! an approached polyhedral representation of an exact
  //! shape. Pay particular attention to this because this
  //! condition is not checked and, if it not respected, an error
  //! may occur in the algorithm for which the bounding box is built.
  //! Note that the resulting bounding box is not enlarged by the
  //! tolerance value of the sub-shapes as is the case with the
  //! Add function. So the added part of the resulting bounding
  //! box is closer to the shape S.

  //! Adds the shape S to the bounding box B.
  //! This algorithm builds precise bounding box,
  //! which differs from exact geometry boundaries of shape only on shape entities tolerances
  //! Algorithm is the same as for method Add(..), but uses more precise methods for building boxes
  //! for geometry objects.
  //! If useShapeTolerance = True, bounding box is enlardged by shape tolerances and
  //! these tolerances are used for numerical methods of bounding box size calculations,
  //! otherwise bounding box is built according to sizes of uderlined geometrical entities,
  //! numerical calculation use tolerance Precision::Confusion().

  //! Two independent methods of computation are implemented:

  //! triangulated shape or shape with planar faces and linear edges).
  //! The second method is based on use of inertia axes and is called
  //! if use of the first method is impossible.
  //! If theIsTriangulationUsed == FALSE then the triangulation will
  //! be ignored at all.
  //! If theIsShapeToleranceUsed == TRUE then resulting box will be
  //! extended on the tolerance of the shape.
  //! theIsOptimal flag defines whether to look for the more tight
  //! OBB for the cost of performance or not.
