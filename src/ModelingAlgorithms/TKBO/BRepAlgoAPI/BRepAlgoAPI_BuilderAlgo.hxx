//! The class contains API level of the General Fuse algorithm.<br>
//!
//! Additionally to the options defined in the base class, the algorithm has
//! the following options:<br>
//! - *Safe processing mode* - allows to avoid modification of the input
//!                            shapes during the operation (by default it is off);
//! - *Gluing options* - allows to speed up the calculation of the intersections
//!                      on the special cases, in which some sub-shapes are coinciding.
//! - *Disabling the check for inverted solids* - Disables/Enables the check of the input solids
//!                          for inverted status (holes in the space). The default value is TRUE,
//!                          i.e. the check is performed. Setting this flag to FALSE for inverted
//!                          solids, most likely will lead to incorrect results.
//! - *Disabling history collection* - allows disabling the collection of the history
//!                                    of shapes modifications during the operation.
//!
//! It returns the following Error statuses:<br>
//! - 0 - in case of success;<br>
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertTooFewArguments* - in case there are no enough arguments to perform the
//! operation;<br>
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertIntersectionFailed* - in case the intersection of the arguments has failed;<br>
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertBuilderFailed* - in case building of the result shape has failed.<br>
//!
//! Warnings statuses from underlying DS Filler and Builder algorithms
//! are collected in the report.
//!
//! The class provides possibility to simplify the resulting shape by unification
//! of the tangential edges and faces. It is performed by the method *SimplifyResult*.
//! See description of this method for more details.

  //! Simplification of the result shape is performed by the means of

  //!
  //! The simplification is performed without creation of the Internal shapes,
  //! i.e. shapes connections will never be broken.
  //!
  //! Simplification is performed on the whole result shape. Thus, if the input
  //! shapes contained connected tangent edges or faces unmodified during the operation
  //! they will also be unified.
  //!
  //! After simplification, the History of result simplification is merged into the main
  //! history of operation. So, it is taken into account when asking for Modified,
  //! Generated and Deleted shapes.
  //!
  //! Some options of the main operation are passed into the Unifier:
  //! - Fuzzy tolerance of the operation is given to the Unifier as the linear tolerance.
  //! - Non destructive mode here controls the safe input mode in Unifier.
  //!
  //! @param theUnifyEdges Controls the edges unification. TRUE by default.
  //! @param theUnifyFaces Controls the faces unification. TRUE by default.
  //! @param theAngularTol Angular criteria for tangency of edges and faces.
