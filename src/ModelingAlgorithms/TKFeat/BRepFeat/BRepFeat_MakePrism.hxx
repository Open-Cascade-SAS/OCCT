//! Describes functions to build prism features.
//! These can be depressions or protrusions.
//! The semantics of prism feature creation is
//! based on the construction of shapes:
//! -   along a length
//! -   up to a limiting face
//! -   from a limiting face to a height.
//! The shape defining construction of the prism feature can be
//! either the supporting edge or the concerned area of a face.
//! In case of the supporting edge, this contour
//! can be attached to a face of the basis shape by
//! binding. When the contour is bound to this face,
//! the information that the contour will slide on the
//! face becomes available to the relevant class methods.
//! In case of the concerned area of a face, you
//! could, for example, cut it out and move it to a
//! different height which will define the limiting
//! face of a protrusion or depression.
