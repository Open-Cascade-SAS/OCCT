//! The general abstract class Geometry in 2D space describes
//! the common behaviour of all the geometric entities.
//!
//! All the objects derived from this class can be move with a
//! geometric transformation. Only the transformations which
//! doesn't modify the nature of the geometry are available in
//! this package.
//! The method Transform which defines a general transformation
//! is deferred. The other specifics transformations used the
//! method Transform.
//! All the following transformations modify the object itself.
//! Warning
//! Only transformations which do not modify the nature
//! of the geometry can be applied to Geom2d objects:
//! this is the case with translations, rotations,
//! symmetries and scales; this is also the case with
//! gp_Trsf2d composite transformations which are
//! used to define the geometric transformations applied
//! using the Transform or Transformed functions.
//! Note: Geometry defines the "prototype" of the
//! abstract method Transform which is defined for each
//! concrete type of derived object. All other
//! transformations are implemented using the Transform method.
