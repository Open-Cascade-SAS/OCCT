//! The abstract class Curve describes the common
//! behavior of curves in 2D space. The Geom2d
//! package provides numerous concrete classes of
//! derived curves, including lines, circles, conics, Bezier
//! or BSpline curves, etc.
//! The main characteristic of these curves is that they
//! are parameterized. The Geom2d_Curve class shows:
//! - how to work with the parametric equation of a
//! curve in order to calculate the point of parameter
//! u, together with the vector tangent and the
//! derivative vectors of order 2, 3,..., N at this point;
//! - how to obtain general information about the curve
//! (for example, level of continuity, closed
//! characteristics, periodicity, bounds of the parameter field);
//! - how the parameter changes when a geometric
//! transformation is applied to the curve or when the
//! orientation of the curve is inverted.
//! All curves must have a geometric continuity: a curve is
//! at least "C0". Generally, this property is checked at
//! the time of construction or when the curve is edited.
//! Where this is not the case, the documentation
//! explicitly states so.
//! Warning
//! The Geom2d package does not prevent the
//! construction of curves with null length or curves which
//! self-intersect.
