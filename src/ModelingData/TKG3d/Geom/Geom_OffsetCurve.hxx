DEFINE_STANDARD_HANDLE(Geom_OffsetCurve, Geom_Curve)

//! This class implements the basis services for an offset curve
//! in 3D space. The Offset curve in this package can be a self
//! intersecting curve even if the basis curve does not
//! self-intersect. The self intersecting portions are not deleted
//! at the construction time.
//! An offset curve is a curve at constant distance (Offset) from
//! a basis curve in a reference direction V. The offset curve
//! takes its parametrization from the basis curve.
//! The Offset curve is in the direction of the normal N
//! defined with the cross product  T^V, where the vector T
//! is given by the first derivative on the basis curve with
//! non zero length.
//! The distance offset may be positive or negative to indicate the
//! preferred side of the curve :
//! . distance offset >0 => the curve is in the direction of N
//! . distance offset <0 => the curve is in the direction of - N
//!
//! On the Offset curve :
//! Value (U) = BasisCurve.Value(U) + (Offset * (T ^ V)) / ||T ^ V||
//!
//! At any point the Offset direction V must not be parallel to the
//! vector T and the vector T must not have null length else the
//! offset curve is not defined. So the offset curve has not the
//! same continuity as the basis curve.
//!
//! Warnings :
//!
//! In this package we suppose that the continuity of the offset
//! curve is one degree less than the continuity of the basis
//! curve and we don't check that at any point ||T^V|| != 0.0
//!
//! So to evaluate the curve it is better to check that the offset
//! curve is well defined at any point because an exception could
//! be raised. The check is not done in this package at the creation
//! of the offset curve because the control needs the use of an
//! algorithm which cannot be implemented in this package.
//!
//! The OffsetCurve is closed if the first point and the last point
//! are the same (The distance between these two points is lower or
//! equal to the Resolution sea package gp) . The OffsetCurve can be
//! closed even if the basis curve is not closed.
