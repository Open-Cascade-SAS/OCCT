//! The  BRepBuilderAPI  package   provides  an   Application
//! Programming Interface  for the BRep  topology data
//! structure.
//!
//! The API is a set of classes aiming to provide :
//!
//! * High level and simple calls  for the most common
//! operations.
//!
//! *    Keeping   an   access  on    the    low-level
//! implementation of high-level calls.
//!
//! * Examples  of programming of high-level operations
//! from low-level operations.
//!
//! * A complete coverage of modelling :
//!
//! - Creating vertices ,edges, faces, solids.
//!
//! - Sweeping operations.
//!
//! - Boolean operations.
//!
//! - Global properties computation.
//!
//! The API provides  classes to  build  objects:
//!
//! * The  constructors  of the classes  provides  the
//! different constructions methods.
//!
//! * The  class keeps as fields the   different tools
//! used to build the object.
//!
//! *   The class  provides  a  casting  method to get
//! automatically the  result  with  a   function-like
//! call.
//!
//! For example to make a  vertex <V> from a point <P>
//! one can writes :
//!
//! V = BRepBuilderAPI_MakeVertex(P);
//!
//! or
//!
//! BRepBuilderAPI_MakeVertex MV(P);
//! V = MV.Vertex();
//!
//! For tolerances  a default precision is  used which
//! can    be   changed    by    the   packahe  method
//! BRepBuilderAPI::Precision.
//!
//! For error handling the BRepBuilderAPI commands raise only
//! the NotDone error. When Done is false on a command
//! the error description can be asked to the command.
//!
//! In  theory  the  comands can be    called with any
//! arguments, argument  checking  is performed by the
//! command.
