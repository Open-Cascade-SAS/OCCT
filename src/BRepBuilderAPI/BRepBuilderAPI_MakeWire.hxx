//! Describes functions to build wires from edges. A wire can
//! be built from any number of edges.
//! To build a wire you first initialize the construction, then
//! add edges in sequence. An unlimited number of edges
//! can be added. The initialization of construction is done with:
//! -   no edge (an empty wire), or
//! -   edges of an existing wire, or
//! -   up to four connectable edges.
//! In order to be added to a wire under construction, an
//! edge (unless it is the first one) must satisfy the following
//! condition: one of its vertices must be geometrically
//! coincident with one of the vertices of the wire (provided
//! that the highest tolerance factor is assigned to the two
//! vertices). It could also be the same vertex.
//! -   The given edge is shared by the wire if it contains:
//! -   two vertices, identical to two vertices of the wire
//! under construction (a general case of the wire closure), or
//! -   one vertex, identical to a vertex of the wire under
//! construction; the other vertex not being
//! geometrically coincident with another vertex of the wire.
//! -   In other cases, when one of the vertices of the edge
//! is simply geometrically coincident with a vertex of the
//! wire under construction (provided that the highest
//! tolerance factor is assigned to the two vertices), the
//! given edge is first copied and the coincident vertex is
//! replaced in this new edge, by the coincident vertex of the wire.
//! Note: it is possible to build non manifold wires using this construction tool.
//! A MakeWire object provides a framework for:
//! -   initializing the construction of a wire,
//! -   adding edges to the wire under construction, and
//! -   consulting the result.
