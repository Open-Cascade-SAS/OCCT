//! A tool providing facility to load definitions of message strings from
//! resource file(s).
//!
//! The message file is an ASCII file which defines a set of messages.
//! Each message is identified by its keyword (string).
//!
//! All lines in the file starting with the exclamation sign
//! (perhaps preceding by spaces and/or tabs) are ignored as comments.
//!
//! Each line in the file starting with the dot character "."
//! (perhaps preceding by spaces and/or tabs) defines the keyword.
//! The keyword is a string starting from the next symbol after dot
//! and ending at the symbol preceding ending newline character "\n".
//!
//! All the lines in the file after the keyword and before next
//! keyword (and which are not comments) define the message for that
//! keyword. If the message consists of several lines, the message
//! string will contain newline symbols "\n" between parts (but not
//! at the end).
//!
//! The experimental support of Unicode message files is provided.
//! These are distinguished by two bytes FF.FE or FE.FF at the beginning.
//!
//! The loaded messages are stored in static data map; all methods of that
//! class are also static.
