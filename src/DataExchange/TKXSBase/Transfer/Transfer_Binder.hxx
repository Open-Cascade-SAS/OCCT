//! A Binder is an auxiliary object to Map the Result of the
//! Transfer of a given Object : it records the Result of the
//! Unitary Transfer (Resulting Object), status of progress and
//! error (if any) of the Process
//!
//! The class Binder itself makes no definition for the Result :
//! it is defined by sub-classes : it can be either Simple (and
//! has to be typed : see generic class SimpleBinder) or Multiple
//! (see class MultipleBinder).
//!
//! In principle, for a Transfer in progress, Result cannot be
//! accessed : this would cause an exception raising.
//! This is controlled by the value if StatusResult : if it is
//! "Used", the Result cannot be changed. This status is normally
//! controlled by TransferProcess but can be directly (see method
//! SetAlreadyUsed)
//!
//! Checks can be completed by a record of cases, as string which
//! can be used as codes, but not to be printed
//!
//! In addition to the Result, a Binder can bring a list of
//! Attributes, which are additional data, each of them has a name
