//! This Tool determines and gives access to effective Locations
//! of IGES Entities as defined by the IGES Norm. These Locations
//! can be for each Entity :
//! - on one part, explicitly defined by a Transf in Directory
//! Part (this Transf can be itself compound); if not defined,
//! no proper Transformation is defined
//! - on the other part, implicitly defined by a reference from
//! another Entity : its Parent
//! Both implicit and explicit locations are combinable.
//!
//! Implicit definition can be itself defined, either through the
//! definition of an Entity (i.e. a Composite Curve references
//! a list of Curves), or by a specific Associativity, of type
//! SingleParentEntity, by which the Location of the Parent is
//! applied to the Childs defined by this Associativity.
//! Remark that a Transf itself has no Location, but it can be
//! compound
//!
//! This is a TShared object, then it is easier to use in an
//! interactive session
