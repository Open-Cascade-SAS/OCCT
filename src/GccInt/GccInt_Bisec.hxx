//! The deferred class GccInt_Bisec is the root class for
//! elementary bisecting loci between two simple geometric
//! objects (i.e. circles, lines or points).
//! Bisecting loci between two geometric objects are such
//! that each of their points is at the same distance from the
//! two geometric objects. It is typically a curve, such as a
//! line, circle or conic.
//! Generally there is more than one elementary object
//! which is the solution to a bisecting loci problem: each
//! solution is described with one elementary bisecting
//! locus. For example, the bisectors of two secant straight
//! lines are two perpendicular straight lines.
//! The GccInt package provides concrete implementations
//! of the following elementary derived bisecting loci:
//! -   lines, circles, ellipses, hyperbolas and parabolas, and
//! -   points (not used in this context).
//! The GccAna package provides numerous algorithms for
//! computing the bisecting loci between circles, lines or
//! points, whose solutions are these types of elementary bisecting locus.
