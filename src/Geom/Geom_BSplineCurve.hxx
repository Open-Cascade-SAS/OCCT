//! Definition of the B_spline curve.
//! A B-spline curve can be
//! Uniform  or non-uniform
//! Rational or non-rational
//! Periodic or non-periodic
//!
//! a b-spline curve is defined by :
//! its degree; the degree for a
//! Geom_BSplineCurve is limited to a value (25)
//! which is defined and controlled by the system.
//! This value is returned by the function MaxDegree;
//! - its periodic or non-periodic nature;
//! - a table of poles (also called control points), with
//! their associated weights if the BSpline curve is
//! rational. The poles of the curve are "control
//! points" used to deform the curve. If the curve is
//! non-periodic, the first pole is the start point of
//! the curve, and the last pole is the end point of
//! the curve. The segment which joins the first pole
//! to the second pole is the tangent to the curve at
//! its start point, and the segment which joins the
//! last pole to the second-from-last pole is the
//! tangent to the curve at its end point. If the curve
//! is periodic, these geometric properties are not
//! verified. It is more difficult to give a geometric
//! signification to the weights but are useful for
//! providing exact representations of the arcs of a
//! circle or ellipse. Moreover, if the weights of all the
//! poles are equal, the curve has a polynomial
//! equation; it is therefore a non-rational curve.
//! - a table of knots with their multiplicities. For a
//! Geom_BSplineCurve, the table of knots is an
//! increasing sequence of reals without repetition;
//! the multiplicities define the repetition of the knots.
//! A BSpline curve is a piecewise polynomial or
//! rational curve. The knots are the parameters of
//! junction points between two pieces. The
//! multiplicity Mult(i) of the knot Knot(i) of
//! the BSpline curve is related to the degree of
//! continuity of the curve at the knot Knot(i),
//! which is equal to Degree - Mult(i)
//! where Degree is the degree of the BSpline curve.
//! If the knots are regularly spaced (i.e. the difference
//! between two consecutive knots is a constant), three
//! specific and frequently used cases of knot
//! distribution can be identified:
//! - "uniform" if all multiplicities are equal to 1,
//! - "quasi-uniform" if all multiplicities are equal to 1,
//! except the first and the last knot which have a
//! multiplicity of Degree + 1, where Degree is
//! the degree of the BSpline curve,
//! - "Piecewise Bezier" if all multiplicities are equal to
//! Degree except the first and last knot which
//! have a multiplicity of Degree + 1, where
//! Degree is the degree of the BSpline curve. A
//! curve of this type is a concatenation of arcs of Bezier curves.
//! If the BSpline curve is not periodic:
//! - the bounds of the Poles and Weights tables are 1
//! and NbPoles, where NbPoles is the number
//! of poles of the BSpline curve,
//! - the bounds of the Knots and Multiplicities tables
//! are 1 and NbKnots, where NbKnots is the
//! number of knots of the BSpline curve.
//! If the BSpline curve is periodic, and if there are k
//! periodic knots and p periodic poles, the period is:
//! period = Knot(k + 1) - Knot(1)
//! and the poles and knots tables can be considered
//! as infinite tables, verifying:
//! - Knot(i+k) = Knot(i) + period
//! - Pole(i+p) = Pole(i)
//! Note: data structures of a periodic BSpline curve
//! are more complex than those of a non-periodic one.
//! Warning
//! In this class, weight value is considered to be zero if
//! the weight is less than or equal to gp::Resolution().

  Standard_EXPORT const TColStd_Array1OfReal& Knots() const;
  
  //! Returns K, the knots sequence of this BSpline curve.
  //! In this sequence, knots with a multiplicity greater than 1 are repeated.
  //! In the case of a non-periodic curve the length of the
  //! sequence must be equal to the sum of the NbKnots
  //! multiplicities of the knots of the curve (where
  //! NbKnots is the number of knots of this BSpline
  //! curve). This sum is also equal to : NbPoles + Degree + 1
  //! where NbPoles is the number of poles and
  //! Degree the degree of this BSpline curve.
  //! In the case of a periodic curve, if there are k periodic
  //! knots, the period is Knot(k+1) - Knot(1).
  //! The initial sequence is built by writing knots 1 to k+1,
  //! which are repeated according to their corresponding multiplicities.
  //! If Degree is the degree of the curve, the degree of
  //! continuity of the curve at the knot of index 1 (or k+1)
  //! is equal to c = Degree + 1 - Mult(1). c
  //! knots are then inserted at the beginning and end of
  //! the initial sequence:
  //! - the c values of knots preceding the first item
  //! Knot(k+1) in the initial sequence are inserted
  //! at the beginning; the period is subtracted from these c values;
  //! - the c values of knots following the last item
  //! Knot(1) in the initial sequence are inserted at
  //! the end; the period is added to these c values.
  //! The length of the sequence must therefore be equal to:
  //! NbPoles + 2*Degree - Mult(1) + 2.
  //! Example
  //! For a non-periodic BSpline curve of degree 2 where:
  //! - the array of knots is: { k1 k2 k3 k4 },
  //! - with associated multiplicities: { 3 1 2 3 },
  //! the knot sequence is:
  //! K = { k1 k1 k1 k2 k3 k3 k4 k4 k4 }
  //! For a periodic BSpline curve of degree 4 , which is
  //! "C1" continuous at the first knot, and where :
  //! - the periodic knots are: { k1 k2 k3 (k4) }
  //! (3 periodic knots: the points of parameter k1 and k4
  //! are identical, the period is p = k4 - k1),
  //! - with associated multiplicities: { 3 1 2 (3) },
  //! the degree of continuity at knots k1 and k4 is:
  //! Degree + 1 - Mult(i) = 2.
  //! 2 supplementary knots are added at the beginning
  //! and end of the sequence:
  //! - at the beginning: the 2 knots preceding k4 minus
  //! the period; in this example, this is k3 - p both times;
  //! - at the end: the 2 knots following k1 plus the period;
  //! in this example, this is k2 + p and k3 + p.
  //! The knot sequence is therefore:
  //! K = { k3-p k3-p k1 k1 k1 k2 k3 k3
  //! k4 k4 k4 k2+p k3+p }
  //! Exceptions
  //! Raised if K.Lower() is less than number of first knot
  //! in knot sequence with repetitions or K.Upper() is more
  //! than number of last knot in knot sequence with repetitions.
