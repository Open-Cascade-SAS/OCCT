/**
 * A data structure for sorting geometric objects (called targets) in 
 * n-dimensional space into cells, with associated algorithm for fast checking 
 * of coincidence (overlapping, intersection, etc.) with other objects 
 * (called here bullets).
 *
 * Description
 * 
 * The algorithm is based on hash map, thus it has linear time of initialization 
 * (O(N) where N is number of cells covered by added targets) and constant-time 
 * search for one bullet (more precisely, O(M) where M is number of cells covered 
 * by the bullet).
 *
 * The idea behind the algorithm is to separate each coordinate of the space
 * into equal-size cells. Note that this works well when cell size is 
 * approximately equal to the characteristic size of the involved objects 
 * (targets and bullets; including tolerance eventually used for coincidence 
 * check). 
 *
 * Usage
 *
 * The target objects to be searched are added to the tool by methods Add(); 
 * each target is classified as belonging to some cell(s). The data on cells 
 * (list of targets found in each one) are stored in the hash map with key being 
 * cumulative index of the cell by all coordinates.
 * Thus the time needed to find targets in some cell is O(1) * O(number of 
 * targets in the cell).
 *
 * As soon as all the targets are added, the algorithm is ready to check for 
 * coincidence.
 * To find the targets coincident with any given bullet, it checks all the 
 * candidate targets in the cell(s) covered by the bullet object 
 * (methods Inspect()).
 *
 * The methods Add() and Inspect() have two flavours each: one accepts
 * single point identifying one cell, another accept two points specifying
 * the range of cells. It should be noted that normally at least one of these
 * methods is called as for range of cells: either due to objects having non-
 * zero size, or in order to account for the tolerance when objects are points.
 *
 * The set of targets can be modified during the process: new targets can be
 * added by Add(), existing targets can be removed by Remove().
 *
 * Implementation
 *
 * The algorithm is implemented as template class, thus it is capable to 
 * work with objects of any type. The only argument of the template should be 
 * the specific class providing all necessary features required by the 
 * algorithm:
 *
 * - typedef "Target" defining type of target objects.
 *   This type must have copy constructor
 *
 * - typedef "Point" defining type of geometrical points used 
 *
 * - enum Dimension whose value must be dimension of the point
 *
 * - method Coord() returning value of the i-th coordinate of the point:
 *
 *   static Standard_Real Coord (int i, const Point& thePnt);
 *
 *   Note that index i is from 0 to Dimension-1.
 *
 * - method IsEqual() used by Remove() to identify objects to be removed:
 *
 *   Standard_Boolean IsEqual (const Target& theT1, const Target& theT2);
 *
 * - method Inspect() performing necessary actions on the candidate target 
 *   object (usially comparison with the currently checked bullet object):
 *
 *   NCollection_CellFilter_Action Inspect (const Target& theObject);
 *
 *   The returned value can be used to command CellFilter
 *   to remove the inspected item from the current cell; this allows
 *   to exclude the items that has been processed and are not needed any 
 *   more in further search (for better performance).
 *
 *   Note that method Inspect() can be const and/or virtual.
