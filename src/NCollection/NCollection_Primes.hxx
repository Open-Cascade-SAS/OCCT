//! Namespace provides a collection of prime numbers.
//!
//! This namespace is used to store a collection of prime numbers that are used as
//! consecutive steps for the size of an array of buckets in a map. The prime
//! numbers are chosen to minimize the probability of having the same hash codes
//! for different map items. The namespace also provides a method to find the next
//! prime number greater than or equal to a given number.
//!
//! The following are Pierpont primes, prime numbers of the form 2^u * 3^v + 1:
//! 101, 1009, 2003, 5003, 10007, 20011, 37003, 57037, 65003, 100019, 209953, 472393,
