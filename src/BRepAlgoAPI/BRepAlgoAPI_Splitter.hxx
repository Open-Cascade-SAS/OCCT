//! The class contains API level of the **Splitter** algorithm,
//! which allows splitting a group of arbitrary shapes by the
//! other group of arbitrary shapes.<br>
//! The arguments of the operation are divided on two groups:<br>
//! *Objects* - shapes that will be split;<br>
//! *Tools*   - shapes by which the *Objects* will be split.<br>
//! The result of the operation contains only the split parts
//! of the shapes from the group of *Objects*.<br>
//! The split parts of the shapes from the group of *Tools* are excluded
//! from the result.<br>
//! The shapes can be split by the other shapes from the same group
//! (in case these shapes are interfering).
//!
//! The class is a General Fuse based algorithm. Thus, all options
//! of the General Fuse algorithm such as Fuzzy mode, safe processing mode,
//! parallel processing mode, gluing mode and history support are also
//! available in this algorithm.<br>
//! There is no requirement on the existence of the *Tools* shapes.
//! And if there are no *Tools* shapes, the result of the splitting
//! operation will be equivalent to the General Fuse result.
//!
//! The algorithm returns the following Error statuses:<br>
//! - 0 - in case of success;<br>
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertTooFewArguments*    - in case there is no enough arguments for the
//! operation;<br>
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertIntersectionFailed* - in case the Intersection of the arguments has failed;<br>
//! - *BOPAlgo_AlertBuilderFailed*      - in case the Building of the result has failed.
