//! - consulting the result.

  //! Constructs offset shape for the given one using simple algorithm without intersections computation.
  Standard_EXPORT void PerformBySimple(const TopoDS_Shape& theS,
                                       const Standard_Real theOffsetValue);

  //! Constructs a shape parallel to the shape S, where
  //! - S may be a face, a shell, a solid or a compound of these shape kinds;
  //! - Offset is the offset value. The offset shape is constructed:
  //! - outside S, if Offset is positive,
  //! - inside S, if Offset is negative;
  //! - Tol defines the coincidence tolerance criterion for generated shapes;
  //! - Mode defines the construction type of parallels
  //! applied to the free edges of shape S; currently, only one
  //! construction type is implemented, namely the one where the free
  //! edges do not generate parallels; this corresponds to the default
  //! value BRepOffset_Skin;
  //! - Intersection specifies how the algorithm must work in
  //! order to limit the parallels to two adjacent shapes:
  //! - if Intersection is false (default value), the intersection
  //! is calculated with the parallels to the two adjacent shapes,
  //! - if Intersection is true, the intersection is calculated by
  //! taking all generated parallels into account; this computation method is
  //! more general as it avoids some self-intersections generated in the
  //! offset shape from features of small dimensions on shape S, however this
  //! method has not been completely implemented and therefore is not
  //! recommended for use;
  //! - SelfInter tells the algorithm whether a computation
  //! to eliminate self-intersections must be applied to the resulting
  //! shape; however, as this functionality is not yet
  //! implemented, it is recommended to use the default value (false);
  //! - Join defines how to fill the holes that may appear between
  //! parallels to the two adjacent faces. It may take values
  //! GeomAbs_Arc or GeomAbs_Intersection:
  //! - if Join is equal to GeomAbs_Arc, then pipes are generated
  //! between two free edges of two adjacent parallels,
  //! and spheres are generated on "images" of vertices;
  //! it is the default value,
  //! - if Join is equal to GeomAbs_Intersection, then the parallels to the
  //! two adjacent faces are enlarged and intersected,
  //! so that there are no free edges on parallels to faces.
  //! RemoveIntEdges flag defines whether to remove the INTERNAL edges 
  //! from the result or not.
  //! Warnings
  //! 1. All the faces of the shape S should be based on the surfaces
  //! with continuity at least C1.
  //! 2. The offset value should be sufficiently small to avoid
  //! self-intersections in resulting shape. Otherwise these
  //! self-intersections may appear inside an offset face if its
  //! initial surface is not plane or sphere or cylinder, also some
  //! non-adjacent offset faces may intersect each other. Also, some
  //! offset surfaces may "turn inside out".
  //! 3. The algorithm may fail if the shape S contains vertices where
  //! more than 3 edges converge.
  //! 4. Since 3d-offset algorithm involves intersection of surfaces,
  //! it is under limitations of surface intersection algorithm.
  //! 5. A result cannot be generated if the underlying geometry of S is
  //! BSpline with continuity C0.
  //! Exceptions
  //! Geom_UndefinedDerivative if the underlying
  //! geometry of S is BSpline with continuity C0.
