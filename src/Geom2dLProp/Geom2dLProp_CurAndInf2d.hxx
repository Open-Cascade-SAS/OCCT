//! These properties include:
//! - the maximum and minimum curvatures
//! - the inflection points.

//! - defining the curve to be analyzed
//! - implementing the computation algorithms
//! - consulting the results.

  //! After computation, the following functions can be used:
  //! - IsDone to check if the computation was successful
  //! - NbPoints to obtain the number of computed particular points
  //! - Parameter to obtain the parameter on the curve for
  //! each particular point
  //! - Type to check if the point is an inflection point or an
