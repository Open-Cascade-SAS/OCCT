//! This  a generic  class  is  used   to build Sweept
//! primitives   with    a  generating  "shape"  and a
//! directing "line".
//!
//! The indexation and type analysis services required
//! for the generatrix are given by <Tool from BRepSweep>.
//!
//! The indexation and type analysis services required
//! for the directrix are given by <NumShapeTool from Sweep>.
//!
//! The iteration services required for the generatrix
//! are given by <Iterator from BRepSweep>.
//!
//! The iteration services required  for the directrix
//! are given by <NumShapeIterator from Sweep>.
//!
//! The topology is like a grid of shapes.  Each shape
//! of the grid  must be addressable without confusion
//! by one  or  two objects   from  the generating  or
//! directing   shapes.  Here are  examples of correct
//! associations to address:
//!
//! - a vertex : GenVertex - DirVertex
//! - an edge  : GenVertex - DirEdge
//! -          : GenEdge   - DirVertex
//! - a face   : GenEdge   - DirEdge
//! GenFace   - DirVertex
//! ...
//!
//! "GenObject" is used to identify an object from the
//! Generating     Shape,  and  "DirObject"  from  the
//! Directing Shape.  So may they   be  from different
//! types.
//!
//! The method Has... is given because in some special
//! cases, a vertex,    an  edge or   a   face may  be
//! geometricaly nonexistant or not useful.
