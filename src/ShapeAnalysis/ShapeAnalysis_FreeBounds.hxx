//! This class is intended to output free bounds of the shape.
//!
//! Free bounds are the wires consisting of edges referenced by the faces of the shape
//! only once; these are the edges composing the outer boundary of the face or shell
//! (as opposed to internal edges between the faces in the shell or seam edges on closed faces).
//!
//! This class works on two distinct types of shapes when analyzing
//! their free bounds:
//! 1. compound of faces.
//! Analyzer of sewing algorithm (BRepAlgo_Sewing) is used for
//! for forecasting free bounds that would be obtained after
//! performing sewing
//! 2. compound of shells.
//! Actual free bounds (edges shared by the only face in the shell)
//! are output in this case. ShapeAnalysis_Shell is used for that.
//!
//! When connecting edges into the wires algorithm tries to build
//! wires of maximum length. Two options are provided for a user
//! to extract closed sub-contours out of closed and/or open contours.
//!
//! Free bounds are returned as two compounds, one for closed and one
//! for open wires.
//!
//! This class also provides some static methods for advanced use:
//! connecting edges/wires to wires, extracting closed sub-wires out
//! of wires, dispatching wires into compounds for closed and open
//! wires.
//! NOTE. Ends of the edge or wire mean hereafter their end vertices.
