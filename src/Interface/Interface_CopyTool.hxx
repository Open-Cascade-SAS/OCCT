//! Performs Deep Copies of sets of Entities
//! Allows to perform Copy of Interface Entities from a Model to
//! another one. Works by calling general services GetFromAnother
//! and GetImplied.
//! Uses a CopyMap to bind a unique Result to each Copied Entity
//!
//! It is possible to command Copies of Entities (and those they
//! reference) by call to the General Service Library, or to
//! enforce results for transfer of some Entities (calling Bind)
//!
//! A Same CopyTool can be used for several successive Copies from
//! the same Model : either by restarting from scratch (e.g. to
//! copy different parts of a starting Model to several Targets),
//! or incremental : in that case, it is possible to know what is
//! the content of the last increment (defined by last call to
//! ClearLastFlags  and queried by call to LastCopiedAfter)
//!
//! Works in two times : first, create the list of copied Entities
//! second, pushes them to a target Model (manages also Model's
//! Header) or returns the Result as an Iterator, as desired
//!
//! The core action (Copy) works by using ShallowCopy (method
//! attached to each class) and Copy from GeneralLib (itself using
//! dedicated tools). It can be redefined for specific actions.
