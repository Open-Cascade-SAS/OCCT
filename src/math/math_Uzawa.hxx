//! This class implements a system resolution C*X = B with

//! minimization of Norm(X-X0).
//! If there are only equal equations, the resolution is directly
//! done and is similar to Gauss resolution with an optimisation
//! because the matrix is a symmetric matrix.
//! (The resolution is done with Crout algorithm)
