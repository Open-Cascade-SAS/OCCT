//! This class implements construction algorithms for an ellipse in
//! 3D space. The result is a Geom_Ellipse ellipse.
//! A MakeEllipse object provides a framework for:
//! -   defining the construction of the ellipse,
//! -   implementing the construction algorithm, and
//! -   consulting the results. In particular, the Value
//! function returns the constructed ellipse.

  //! Constructs an ellipse with major and minor radii MajorRadius and
  //! MinorRadius, and located in the plane defined by
  //! the "X Axis" and "Y Axis" of the coordinate system A2, where:
  //! -   its center is the origin of A2, and
  //! -   its major axis is the "X Axis" of A2;
  //! Warnings :
  //! The MakeEllipse class does not prevent the
  //! construction of an ellipse where MajorRadius is equal to MinorRadius.
  //! If an error occurs (that is, when IsDone returns
  //! false), the Status function returns:
  //! -   gce_InvertRadius if MajorRadius is less than MinorRadius;
  //! -   gce_NegativeRadius if MinorRadius is less than 0.0;
  //! -   gce_NullAxis if the points S1 and Center are coincident; or
  //! -   gce_InvertAxis if:
  //! -   the major radius computed with Center and S1
  //! is less than the minor radius computed with Center, S1 and S2, or
  //! -   Center, S1 and S2 are collinear.
