//! This class gives a frame for Actions which modify the effect
//! of a Dispatch, i.e. :
//! By Selections and Dispatches, an original Model can be
//! split into one or more "target" Models : these Models
//! contain Entities copied from the original one (that is, a
//! part of it). Basically, these dispatched Entities are copied
//! as identical to their original counterparts. Also the copied
//! Models reproduce the Header of the original one.
//!
//! Modifiers allow to change this copied content : this is the
//! way to be used for any kind of alterations, adaptations ...
//! They are exploited by a ModelCopier, which firstly performs
//! the copy operation described by Dispatches, then invokes the
//! Modifiers to work on the result.
//!
//! Each GeneralModifier can be attached to :
//! - all the Models produced
//! - a Dispatch (it will be applied to all the Models obtained
//! from this Dispatch) designated by its Ident in a ShareOut
//! - in addition, to a Selection (facultative) : this adds a
//! criterium, the Modifier is invoked on a produced Model only
//! if this Model contains an Entity copied from one of the
//! Entities designated by this Selection.
//! (for special Modifiers from IFAdapt, while they must work on
//! definite Entities, this Selection is mandatory to run)
//!
//! Remark : this class has no action attached, it only provides
//! a frame to work on criteria. Then, sub-classes will define
//! their kind of action, which can be applied at a precise step
//! of the production of a File : see Modifier, and in the
//! package IFAdapt, EntityModifier and EntityCopier
