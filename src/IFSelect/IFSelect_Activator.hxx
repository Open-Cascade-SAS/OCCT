//! Defines the general frame for working with a SessionPilot.
//! Each Activator treats a set of Commands. Commands are given as
//! alphanumeric strings. They can be of two main forms :
//! - classic, to list, evaluate, enrich the session (by itself) :
//! no specific remark, its complete execution must be described
//! - creation of a new item : instead of creatinf it plus adding
//! it to the session (which is a classic way), it is possible
//! to create it and make it recorded by the SessionPilot :
//! then, the Pilot will add it to the session; this way allows
//! the Pilot to manage itself named items
//!
//! In order to make easier the use of Activator, this class
//! provides a simple way to Select an Actor for a Command :
//! each sub-class of SectionActor defines the command titles it
//! recognizes, plus attaches a Number, unique for this sub-class,
//! to each distinct command title.
//!
//! Each time an action is required, the corresponding Number
//! can then be given to help the selection of the action to do.
//!
//! The result of an Execution must indicate if it is worth to be
//! recorded or not : see method Do
