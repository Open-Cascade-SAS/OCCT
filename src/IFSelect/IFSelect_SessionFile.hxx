class IFSelect_WorkSession;

//! A SessionFile is intended to manage access between a
//! WorkSession and an Ascii Form, to be considered as a Dump.
//! It allows to write the File from the WorkSession, and later
//! read the File to the WorkSession, by keeping required
//! descriptions (such as dependances).
//!
//! The produced File is under an Ascii Form, then it may be
//! easily consulted.
//! It is possible to cumulate reading of several Files. But in
//! case of Names conflict, the newer Names are forgottens.
//!
//! The Dump supports the description of XSTEP functionalities
//! (Sharing an Interface File, with Selections, Dispatches,
//! Modifiers ...) but does not refer to the Interface File
//! which is currently loaded.
//!
//! SessionFile works with a library of SessionDumper type objects
//!
//! The File is Produced as follows :
//! SessionFile produces all general Information (such as Int and
//! Text Parameters, Types and Inputs of Selections, Dispatches,
//! Modifiers ...) and calls the SessionDumpers to produce all
//! the particular Data : creation arguments, parameters to be set
//! It is Read in the same terms :
//! SessionFile reads and interprets all general Information,
//! and calls the SessionDumpers to recognize Types and for a
//! recognized Type create the corresponding Object with its
//! particular parameters as they were written.
//! The best way to work is to have one SessionDumper for each
//! consistent set of classes (e.g. a package).
