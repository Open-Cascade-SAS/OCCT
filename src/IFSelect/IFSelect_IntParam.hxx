//! This class simply allows to access an Integer value through a

//! Hence, this value can be accessed : read and modified, without
//! passing through the specific object which detains it. Thus,
//! parameters of a Selection or a Dispatch (according its type)
//! can be controlled directly from the ShareOut which contains them
//!
//! Additionally, an IntParam can be bound to a Static.
//! Remember that for a String, binding is immediate, because the
//! string value of a Static is a HAsciiString, it then suffices
//! to get its Handle.
//! For an Integer, an IntParam can designate (by its name) a
//! Static : each time its value is required or set, the Static
//! is acknowledged
