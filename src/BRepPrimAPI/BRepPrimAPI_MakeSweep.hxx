//! The abstract class MakeSweep is
//! the root class of swept primitives.
//! Sweeps are objects you obtain by sweeping a profile along a path.
//! The profile can be any topology and the path is usually a curve or
//! a wire. The profile generates objects according to the following rules:
//! -      Vertices generate Edges
//! -      Edges generate Faces.
//! -      Wires generate Shells.
//! -      Faces generate Solids.
//! -      Shells generate Composite  Solids.
//! You are not allowed to sweep Solids and Composite Solids.
//! Two kinds of sweeps are implemented in the BRepPrimAPI package:
//! -      The linear sweep called a   Prism
//! -      The rotational sweep    called a Revol
//! Swept constructions along complex profiles such as BSpline curves
//! are also available in the BRepOffsetAPI package..
