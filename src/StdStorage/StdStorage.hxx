//! StdStorage package is used to write and read persistent objects.
//! These objects are read and written by a retrieval or storage
//! algorithm (compatible with legacy Storage_Schema) in a container
//! (disk, memory, network ...). Drivers (FSD_File objects) assign a physical
//! container for data to be stored or retrieved.
//! The standard procedure for an application in reading a container is
//!  to call one of the Read functions providing either a file path or a driver
//! opened for reading. Thes function update the instance of the StdStorage_Data
//! class which contains the data being read.
//! The standard procedure for an application in writing a container is the following:
//! -   open the driver in writing mode,
//! -   create an instance of the StdStorage_Data class, then
//! add the persistent data to write with the function AddRoot,
//! -   call the function Write from the storage, setting the driver and the
//! Storage_Data instance as parameters,
//! -   close the driver.
