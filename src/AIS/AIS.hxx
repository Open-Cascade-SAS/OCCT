//! Application Interactive Services provide the means to create links between an application GUI viewer and
//! the packages which are used to manage selection and presentation.
//! The tools AIS defined in order to do this include different sorts of entities:
//! both the selectable viewable objects themselves and the context and attribute managers to define their selection and display.
//! To orient the user as he works in a modeling environment, views and selections must be comprehensible.
//! There must be several different sorts of selectable and viewable object defined.
//! These must also be interactive, that is, connecting graphic representation and the underlying reference geometry.
//! These entities are called Interactive Objects, and are divided into four types:
//! -   the Datum
//! -   the Relation
//! -   the Object
//! -   None.
//! The Datum groups together the construction elements such as lines, circles, points, trihedra, plane trihedra, planes and axes.
//! The Relation is made up of constraints on one or more interactive shapes and the corresponding reference geometry.
//! For example, you might want to constrain two edges in a parallel relation.
//! This constraint is considered as an object in its own right, and is shown as a sensitive primitive.
//! This takes the graphic form of a perpendicular arrow marked with the || symbol and lying between the two edges.
//! The Object type includes topological shapes, and connections between shapes.
//! None, in order not to eliminate the object, tells the application to look further until it finds an object definition in its generation which is accepted.
//! Inside these categories, you have the possibility of an additional characterization by means of a signature.
//! The signature provides an index to the further characterization.
//! By default, the Interactive Object has a None type and a signature of 0 (equivalent to None.)
//! If you want to give a particular type and signature to your interactive object, you must redefine the two virtual methods: Type and Signature.
//! In the C++ inheritance structure of the package, each class representing a specific Interactive Object inherits AIS_InteractiveObject.
//! Among these inheriting classes, AIS_Relation functions as the abstract mother class for tinheriting classes defining display of specific relational constraints and types of dimension.
//! Some of these include:
//! -   display of constraints based on relations of symmetry, tangency, parallelism and concentricity
//! -   display of dimensions for angles, offsets, diameters, radii and chamfers.
//! No viewer can show everything at once with any coherence or clarity.
//! Views must be managed carefully both sequentially and at any given instant.
//! Another function of the view is that of a context to carry out design in.
//! The design changes are applied to the objects in the view and then extended to the underlying reference geometry by a solver.
//! To make sense of this complicated visual data, several display and selection tools are required.
//! To facilitate management, each object and each construction element has a selection priority.
//! There are also means to modify the default priority.
//! To define an environment of dynamic detection, you can use standard filter classes or create your own.
//! A filter questions the owner of the sensitive primitive to determine if it has the desired qualities.
//! If it answers positively, it is kept. If not, it is rejected.
//! The standard filters supplied in AIS include:
//! - AIS_AttributeFilter
//! - AIS_SignatureFilter
//! - AIS_TypeFilter.
//! A set of functions allows you to choose the interactive objects which you want to act on, the selection modes which you want to activate.
//! An interactive object can have a certain number of graphic attributes which are specific to it, such as visualization mode, color, and material.
//! By the same token, the interactive context has a set of graphic attributes, the Drawer which is valid by default for the objects it controls.
//! When an interactive object is visualized, the required graphic attributes are first taken from the object's own Drawer if one exists, or from the context drawer for the others.
