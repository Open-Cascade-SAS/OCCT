#ifndef OSD_ThreadFunction_HeaderFile

//! Typedef for prototype of function to be used as main function of a thread.
//!
//! Note: currently we use the same prototype for thread functions on all platforms,
//! in order to make user programs less platform-dependent.
//! However, there is a distinction in returned value for the thread function
//! on UNIX/Linux (void*) and Windows (DWORD) systems.
//! Thus on Windows we have to encode returned void* as DWORD.
//! It is OK for WIN32, but potentially problem on WIN64.
//! To avoid any problems with this, for better application portability it is recommended
//! that the thread function returns just integer (casted to void*).
//! This shall work on all platforms.
