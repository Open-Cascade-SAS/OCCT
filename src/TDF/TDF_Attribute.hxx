DEFINE_STANDARD_HANDLE(TDF_Attribute, Standard_Transient)

//! A class each application has to implement. It is
//! used to contain the application data.
//! This abstract class, alongwith Label,
//! is one of the cornerstones of Model Editor.
//! The groundwork is to define the root of
//! information. This information is to be
//! attached to a Label, and could be of any of
//! the following types:
//! -   a feature
//! -   a constraint
//! -   a comment
//!
//! Contents:
//! ---------
//!
//! Each software component who'd like to attach its
//! own information to a label has to inherit from
//! this class and has to add its own information as
//! fields of this new class.
//!
//! Identification:
//! ---------------
//!
//! An attribute can be identified by its ID. Every
//! attributes used with the same meaning (for
//! example: Integer, String, Topology...) have the
//! same worldwide unique ID.
//!
//! Addition:
//! ---------
//!
//! An attribute can be added to a label only if there
//! is no attribute yet with the same ID. Call-back
//! methods are offered, called automatically before
//! and after the addition action.
//!
//! Removal:
//! --------
//!
//! An attribute can be removed from a label only if
//! there is an attribute yet with the same
//! ID. Call-back methods are offered, called
//! automatically before and after the removal
//! action. A removed attribute cannot be found
//! again. After a removal, only an addition of an
//! attribute with the sane ID is possible (no
//! backup...).
//!
//! Modification & Transaction:
//! ---------------------------
//!
//! An attribute can be backuped before a
//! modification. Only one backup attribute by
//! transaction is possible. The modification can be
//! forgotten (abort transaction) or validated (commit
//! transaction).
//!
//! BackupCopy and restore are methods used by the backup or
//! abort transaction actions. BackupCopy is called by
//! Backup to generate an attribute with the same
//! contents as the current one. Restore is called
//! when aborting a transaction to transfer the
//! backuped contents into the current
//! attribute. These methods must be implemented by
//! end use inheriting classes.
//!
//! A standard implementation of BackupCopy is provided, but
//! it is not necessary a good one for any use.
//!
//! Copy use methods:
//! -----------------
//!
//! Paste and NewEmpty methods are used by the copy
//! algorithms. The goal of "Paste" is to transfer an
//! attribute new contents into another attribute. The
//! goal of "NewEmpty" is to create an attribute
//! without contents, to be further filled with the
//! new contents of another one. These 2 methods must
//! be implemented by end use inheriting classes.
//!
//! AttributeDelta:
//! ---------------
//!
//! An AttributeDelta is the difference between to
//! attribute values states.  These methods must be
//! implemented by end use inheriting classes, to
//! profit from the delta services.
