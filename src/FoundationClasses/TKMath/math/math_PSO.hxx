class math_PSOParticlesPool;

//! In this class implemented variation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method.
//! A. Ismael F. Vaz, L. N. Vicente
//! "A particle swarm pattern search method for bound constrained global optimization"
//!
//! Algorithm description:
//! Init Section:
//! At start of computation a number of "particles" are placed in the search space.
//! Each particle is assigned a random velocity.
//!
//! Computational loop:
//! The particles are moved in cycle, simulating some "social" behavior, so that new position of
//! a particle on each step depends not only on its velocity and previous path, but also on the
//! position of the best particle in the pool and best obtained position for current particle.
//! The velocity of the particles is decreased on each step, so that convergence is guaranteed.
//!
//! Algorithm output:
//! Best point in param space (position of the best particle) and value of objective function.
//!
//! Pros:
//! One of the fastest algorithms.
//! Work over functions with a lot local extremums.
//! Does not require calculation of derivatives of the functional.
//!
//! Cons:
//! Convergence to global minimum not proved, which is a typical drawback for all stochastic
//! algorithms. The result depends on random number generator.
//!
//! Warning: PSO is effective to walk into optimum surrounding, not to get strict optimum.
//! Run local optimization from pso output point.
//! Warning: In PSO used fixed seed in RNG, so results are reproducible.
