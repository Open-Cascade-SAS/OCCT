@section specification__boolean_1 Introduction

Boolean operations are used to create new shapes from the combinations of two groups of shapes.
This document provides a comprehensive description of the algorithms in the Boolean Operations Component as it is implemented in Open CASCADE Technology. The Boolean Component contains:

* General Fuse Operator (GFA), 
* Boolean Operator (BOA), 
* Section Operator (SA), 
* Splitter Operator (SPA). 

GFA is the base algorithm for BOA, SPA, SA.

GFA has a history-based architecture designed to allow using OCAF naming functionality. The architecture of GFA is expandable, that allows creating new algorithms basing on it.


@section specification__boolean_2 Overview 

@subsection specification__boolean_2_1 Operators

@subsubsection specification__boolean_2_1_1 Boolean operator

The Boolean operator provides the following operations between two groups *Objects* and *Tools*:
* FUSE - Union of two groups;
* COMMON - Intersection of two groups;
* CUT - Difference between two groups.

Each group consists of an arbitrary number of arguments in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*.

The operator can be represented as:

<i>R<sub>B</sub>=B<sub>j</sub> (G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>),</i>	

where:
* *R<sub>B</sub>* -- result of the operation;
* *B<sub>j</sub>* -- operation of type *j* (Common, Fuse, Cut);
* *G<sub>1</sub>={S<sub>11</sub>, S<sub>12</sub> ... S<sub>1n1</sub>}*  group of arguments (Objects); 
* *G<sub>2</sub>={S<sub>21</sub>, S<sub>22</sub> ... S<sub>2n2</sub>}*  group of arguments (Tools);
* *n<sub>1</sub>* -- Number of arguments in *Objects* group; 
* *n<sub>2</sub>* -- Number of arguments in *Tools* group.


**Note** There is an operation *Cut21*, which is an extension for forward Cut operation, i.e <i>Cut21=Cut(G2, G1)</i>.

For more details see @ref specification__boolean_9 "Boolean Operations Algorithm" section.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_2_1_2 General Fuse operator

The General fuse operator can be applied to an arbitrary number of arguments in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*.

The GFA operator can be represented as:

<i>R<sub>GF</sub> = GF (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub> ... S<sub>n</sub>), </i>	

where
* *R<sub>GF</sub>* -- result of the operation,
* *S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub> ... S<sub>n</sub>* -- arguments of the operation,
* *n* -- number of arguments.

The result of the Boolean operator, *R<sub>B</sub>*, can be obtained from *R<sub>GF</sub>*.

For example, for two arguments *S<sub>1</sub>* and *S<sub>2</sub>* the result *R<sub>GF</sub>* is

<i>R<sub>GF</sub> = GF (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p1</sub> + S<sub>p2</sub> + S<sub>p12</sub></i>	

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image001.svg,"Operators",320}

This Figure shows that 
* <i>B<sub>common</sub> (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p12</sub>;</i>
* <i>B<sub>cut12</sub> (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p1</sub>;</i>
* <i>B<sub>cut21</sub> (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p2</sub>;</i>
* <i>B<sub>fuse</sub> (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p1</sub>+S<sub>p2</sub>+S<sub>p12</sub></i>

<i>R<sub>GF</sub>=GF (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = B<sub>fuse</sub> = B<sub>common</sub>+ B<sub>cut12</sub>+ B<sub>cut21</sub>.</i>

The fact that *R<sub>GF</sub>* contains the components of *R<sub>B</sub>* allows considering GFA as the general case of BOA. So it is possible to implement BOA as a subclass of GFA.

For more details see @ref specification__boolean_7 "General Fuse Algorithm" section.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_2_1_3 Splitter operator 

The Splitter operator can be applied to an arbitrary number of arguments in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*. The arguments are divided into two groups: *Objects* and *Tools*. The result of *SPA* contains all parts that belong to the *Objects* but does not contain the parts that belong to the *Tools*.

The *SPA* operator can be represented as follows:

<i>R<sub>SPA</sub>=SPA (G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>),</i>
where:
* <i>R<sub>SPA</sub></i> -- is the result of the operation; 
* *G<sub>1</sub>={S<sub>11</sub>, S<sub>12</sub> ... S<sub>1n1</sub>}*  group of arguments (*Objects*); 
* *G<sub>2</sub>={S<sub>21</sub>, S<sub>22</sub> ... S<sub>2n2</sub>}*  group of arguments (*Tools*);
* *n<sub>1</sub>* -- Number of arguments in *Objects* group; 
* *n<sub>2</sub>* -- Number of arguments in *Tools* group.

The result *R<sub>SPA</sub>* can be obtained from *R<sub>GF</sub>* .

For example, for two arguments *S<sub>1</sub>* and  *S<sub>2</sub>* the result *R<sub>SPA</sub>* is

<i>R<sub>SPA</sub>=SPA(S<sub>1</sub>,S<sub>2</sub>)=S<sub>p1</sub>+S<sub>p12</sub>.</i>      

In case when all arguments of the *SPA* are *Objects* and there are no *Tools*, the result of *SPA* is equivalent to the result of *GFA*. 

For example, when *G<sub>1</sub>* consists of shapes *S<sub>1</sub>* and *S<sub>2</sub>* the result of *SPA* is

<i>R<sub>SPA</sub>=SPA(S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p1</sub> + S<sub>p2</sub> + S<sub>p12</sub> = GF (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>)</i>

The fact that the *R<sub>GF</sub>* contains the components of *R<sub>SPA</sub>* allows considering *GFA* as the general case of *SPA*. Thus, it is possible to implement *SPA* as a subclass of *GFA*.

For more details see @ref specification__boolean_8 "Splitter Algorithm" section.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_2_1_4 Section operator

The Section operator *SA* can be applied to arbitrary number of arguments in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*. The result of *SA* contains vertices and edges in accordance with interferences between the arguments 
The SA operator can be represented as follows:
<i>R<sub>SA</sub>=SA(S1, S2â€¦ Sn)</i>, where
* <i>R<sub>SA</sub></i> -- the operation result;
* <i>S1, S2 ... Sn</i> -- the operation arguments;
* *n* -- the number of arguments.

For more details see @ref specification__boolean_10a "Section Algorithm" section.

@subsection specification__boolean_2_2 Parts of algorithms 

GFA, BOA, SPA and SA have the same Data Structure (DS). The main goal of the Data Structure is to store all necessary information for input data and intermediate results.

The operators consist of two main parts:
*	Intersection Part (IP). The main goal of IP is to compute the interferences between sub-shapes of arguments. The IP uses DS to retrieve input data and store the results of intersections.
*	Building Part (BP). The main goal of BP is to build required result of an operation. This part also uses DS to retrieve data and store the results.

As it follows from the definition of operator results, the main differences between GFA, BOA, SPA and SA are in the Building Part. The Intersection Part is the same for the algorithms.

@section specification__boolean_3 Terms and Definitions

This chapter provides the background terms and definitions that are necessary to understand how the algorithms work. 

@subsection specification__boolean_3_1 Interferences

There are two groups of interferences.

At first, each shape having a boundary representation (vertex, edge, face) has an internal value of geometrical tolerance. The shapes interfere with each other in terms of their tolerances. The shapes that have a boundary representation interfere when there is a part of 3D space where the distance between the underlying geometry of shapes is less or equal to the sum of tolerances of the shapes. Three types of shapes: vertex, edge and face -- produce six types of **BRep interferences:**
* Vertex/Vertex,
* Vertex/Edge,
* Vertex/Face,
* Edge/Edge, 
* Edge/Face and 
* Face/Face.

At second, there are interferences that occur between a solid *Z1* and a shape *S2* when *Z1* and *S2* have no BRep interferences but *S2* is completely inside of *Z1*. These interferences are **Non-BRep interferences**. There are four possible cases:
* Vertex/Solid, 
* Edge/Solid, 
* Face/Solid and 
* Solid/Solid.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_1 Vertex/Vertex interference

For two vertices *Vi* and *Vj*, the distance between their corresponding 3D points is less than the sum of their tolerances *Tol(Vi)* and *Tol(Vj)*.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image002.svg,"Vertex/vertex interference",420}

The result is a new vertex *Vn* with 3D point *Pn* and tolerance value <i>Tol(Vn)</i>. 

The coordinates of *Pn* and the value <i>Tol(Vn)</i> are computed as the center and the radius of the sphere enclosing the tolerance spheres of the source vertices <i>(V1, V2)</i>.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_2	Vertex/Edge interference

For a vertex *Vi* and an edge *Ej*, the distance *D* between 3D point of the vertex and its projection on the 3D curve of edge *Ej* is less or equal than sum of tolerances of vertex *Tol(Vi)* and edge *Tol(Ej)*.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image003.svg,"Vertex/edge interference",420}

The result is vertex *Vi* with the corresponding tolerance value <i>Tol(Vi)=Max(Tol(Vi), D+Tol(Ej))</i>, where <i>D = distance (Pi, PPi)</i>; 

and parameter *t<sub>i</sub>* of the projected point *PPi* on 3D curve *Cj* of edge *Ej*.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_3	Vertex/Face interference

For a vertex *Vi* and a face *Fj* the distance *D* between 3D point of the vertex and its projection on the surface of the face is less or equal than sum of tolerances of the vertex *Tol(Vi)* and the face *Tol(Fj)*. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image004.svg,"Vertex/face interference",420}

The result is vertex *Vi* with the corresponding tolerance value <i>Tol(Vi)=Max(Tol(Vi), D+Tol(Fj))</i>, where <i>D = distance (Pi, PPi)</i>

and parameters <i>u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub></i> of the projected point *PPi* on surface *Sj* of face *Fj*.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_4	Edge/Edge interference

For two edges *Ei* and *Ej* (with the corresponding 3D curves *Ci* and *Cj*) there are some places where the distance between the curves is less than (or equal to) sum of tolerances of the edges. 

Let us examine two cases:

In  the first case two edges have one or several common parts of 3D curves in terms of tolerance.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image005.svg,"Edge/edge interference: common parts",420}

The results are: 
* Parametric range <i>[t<sub>i1</sub>, t<sub>i2</sub> ]</i> for 3D curve *Ci* of edge *Ei*.
* Parametric range <i>[t<sub>j1</sub>, t<sub>j2</sub> ]</i> for 3D curve *Cj* of edge *Ej*. 

In the second case two edges have one or several common points in terms of tolerance.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image006.svg,"Edge/edge interference: common points",420}

The result is a new vertex *Vn* with 3D point *Pn* and tolerance value *Tol(Vn)*.

The coordinates of *Pn* and the value *Tol(Vn)* are computed as the center and the radius of the sphere enclosing the tolerance spheres of the corresponding nearest points *Pi*, *Pj* of 3D curves *Ci*, *Cj* of source edges *Ei*, *Ej*. 

* Parameter *t<sub>i</sub>* of *Pi* for the 3D curve *Ci*.
* Parameter *t<sub>j</sub>* of *Pj* for the 3D curve *Cj*.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_5	Edge/Face interference

For an edge *Ei* (with the corresponding 3D curve *Ci*) and a face *Fj* (with the corresponding 3D surface *Sj*) there are some places in 3D space, where the distance between *Ci* and surface *Sj* is less than (or equal to) the sum of tolerances of edge *Ei* and face *Fj*.

Let us examine two cases:

In the first case Edge *Ei* and Face *Fj* have one or several common parts in terms of tolerance. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image007.svg,"Edge/face interference: common parts",420}

The result is a parametric range <i>[t<sub>i1</sub>, t<sub>i2</sub>]</i> for the 3D curve *Ci* of the edge *Ei*.

In the second case Edge *Ei* and Face *Fj* have one or several common points in terms of tolerance.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image008.svg,"Edge/face interference: common points",420}

The result is a new vertex *Vn* with 3D point *Pn* and tolerance value *Tol(Vn)*. 

The coordinates of *Pn* and the value *Tol(Vn)* are computed as the center and the radius of the sphere enclosing the tolerance spheres of the corresponding nearest points *Pi*, *Pj* of 3D curve *Ci* and surface *Sj* of source edges *Ei*, *Fj*.

*	Parameter *t<sub>i</sub>* of *Pi* for the 3D curve *Ci*.
*	Parameters *u<sub>i</sub>* and *v<sub>i</sub>* of the projected point *PPi* on the surface *Sj* of the face *Fj*.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_6	Face/Face Interference

For a face *Fi* and a face *Fj* (with the corresponding surfaces *Si* and *Sj*) there are some places in 3D space, where the distance between the surfaces is less than (or equal to) sum of tolerances of the faces.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image009.svg,"Face/face interference: common curves",418}

In the first case the result contains intersection curves *C<sub>ijk</sub> (k = 0, 1, 2â€¦k<sub>N</sub>,* where *k<sub>N</sub>* is the number of intersection curves with corresponding values of tolerances *Tol(C<sub>ijk</sub>)*.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image010.svg,"Face/face interference: common points",305}

In the second case Face *Fi* and face *Fj* have one or several new vertices *V<sub>ijm</sub>*, where <i>m=0,1,2, ... mN, mN </i> is the number of intersection points.

The coordinates of a 3D point *P<sub>ijm</sub>* and the value *Tol(V<sub>ijm</sub>)* are computed as the center and the radius of the sphere enclosing the tolerance spheres of the corresponding nearest points *Pi*, *Pj* of the surface *Si*, *Sj* of source shapes *Fi*, *Fj*.

* Parameters *u<sub>j</sub>*, *v<sub>j</sub>* belong to point *PPj* projected on surface *Sj* of face *Fj*.
* Parameters *u<sub>i</sub>* and *v<sub>i</sub>* belong to point *PPi* projected on surface *Si* of face *Fi*. 

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_7	Vertex/Solid Interference

For a vertex *Vi* and a solid *Zj* there is Vertex/Solid interference if the vertex *Vi* has no BRep interferences with any sub-shape of *Zj* and *Vi* is completely inside the solid *Zj*.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image060.png,"Vertex/Solid Interference",220}

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_8 Edge/Soild Interference

For an edge *Ei* and a solid *Zj* there is Edge/Solid interference if the edge *Ei* and its sub-shapes have no BRep interferences with any sub-shape of *Zj* and *Ei* is completely inside the solid *Zj*.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image061.png,"Edge/Solid Interference",220}

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_9 Face/Soild Interference

For a face *Fi* and a solid *Zj* there is Face/Solid interference if the face *Fi* and its sub-shapes have no BRep interferences with any sub-shape of *Zj* and *Fi* is completely inside the solid *Zj*. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image062.png,"Face/Solid Interference",220}

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_10  Solid/Soild Interference

For a solid *Zi* and a solid *Zj* there is Solid/Solid interference if the solid *Zi* and its sub-shapes have no BRep interferences with any sub-shape of *Zj* and *Zi* is completely inside the solid *Zj*. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image063.png,"Solid/Solid Interference",220}


@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_11 Computation Order

The interferences between shapes are computed on the basis of increasing of the dimension value of the shape in the following order: 
* Vertex/Vertex, 
* Vertex/Edge, 
* Edge/Edge, 
* Vertex/Face, 
* Edge/Face, 
* Face/Face, 
* Vertex/Solid,
* Edge/Solid,
* Face/Solid,
* Solid/Solid.

This order allows avoiding the computation of redundant interferences between upper-level shapes *Si* and  *Sj* when there are interferences between lower sub-shapes *Sik* and *Sjm*.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_3_1_12	Results

* The result of the interference is a shape that can be either interfered shape itself (or its part) or a new shape.
* The result of the interference is a shape with the dimension value that is less or equal to the minimal dimension value of interfered shapes. For example, the result of Vertex/Edge interference is a vertex, but not an edge.
* The result of the interference splits the source shapes on the parts each time as it can do that.

@subsection specification__boolean_3_2	Paves

The result of interferences of the type Vertex/Edge, Edge/Edge and Edge/Face in most cases is a vertex (new or old) lying on an edge.

The result of interferences of the type Face/Face in most cases is intersection curves, which go through some vertices lying on the faces.

The position of vertex *Vi* on curve *C* can be defined by a value of parameter <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> of the 3D point of the vertex on the curve.
Pave *PVi* on curve *C* is a structure containing the vertex *Vi* and correspondent value of the parameter  <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> of the 3D point of the vertex on the curve. Curve *C* can be a 3D or a 2D curve.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image011.svg,"Paves",340}

Two paves *PV1* and *PV2* on the same curve *C* can be compared using the parameter value @code PV1 > PV2 if t1 > t2 @endcode  

The usage of paves allows binding of the vertex to the curve (or any structure that contains a curve: edge, intersection curve).


@subsection specification__boolean_3_3	Pave Blocks

A set of paves *PVi (i=1, 2...nPV)*, where *nPV* is the number of paves] of curve *C* can be sorted in the increasing order using the value of parameter *t* on curve *C*.

A pave block *PBi* is a part of the object (edge, intersection curve) between neighboring paves. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image012.svg,"Pave Blocks",340}

Any finite source edge *E* has at least one pave block that contains two paves *PVb* and *PVe*:
* Pave *PVb* corresponds to the vertex *Vb* with minimal parameter <i>t<sub>b</sub></i> on the curve of the edge.
* Pave *PVe* corresponds to the vertex *Ve* with maximal parameter <i>t<sub>e</sub></i> on the curve of the edge.

@subsection specification__boolean_3_4 Shrunk Range

Pave block *PV* of curve *C* is bounded by vertices *V1* and *V2* with tolerance values *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)*. Curve *C* has its own tolerance value *Tol(C)*:
* In case of edge, the tolerance value is the tolerance of the edge.
* In case of intersection curve, the tolerance value is obtained from an intersection algorithm.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image013.svg,"Shrunk Range",340}

The theoretical parametric range of the pave block is <i>[t1C, t2C]</i>.

The positions of the vertices *V1* and *V2* of the pave block can be different. The positions are determined by the following conditions:
~~~~
Distance (P1, P1c) is equal or less than Tol(V1) + Tol(C)
Distance (P2, P2c) is equal or less than Tol(V2) + Tol(C)
~~~~
The Figure shows that each tolerance sphere of a vertex can reduce the parametric range of the pave block to a range <i>[t1S, t2S]</i>. The range <i>[t1S, t2S]</i> is the shrunk range of the pave block. 

The shrunk range of the pave block is the part of 3D curve that can interfere with other shapes.

@subsection specification__boolean_3_5 Common Blocks

The interferences of the type Edge/Edge, Edge/Face produce results as common parts.

In case of Edge/Edge interference the common parts are pave blocks that have different base edges. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image014.svg,"Common Blocks: Edge/Edge interference",340}

If the pave blocks <i>PB<sub>1</sub>, PB<sub>2</sub>â€¦PB<sub>NbPB</sub></i> , where *NbPB* is the number of pave blocks have the same bounding vertices and geometrically coincide, the pave blocks form common block *CB*.
	

In case of Edge/Face interference the common parts are pave blocks lying on a face(s).

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image015.svg,"Common Blocks: Edge/Face interference",265}

If the pave blocks *PBi* geometrically coincide with a face *Fj*, the pave blocks form common block *CB*.

In general case a common block *CB* contains:
* Pave blocks *PBi (i=0,1,2, 3â€¦ NbPB)*.
* A set of faces *Fj (j=0,1... NbF), NbF* -- number of faces.


@subsection specification__boolean_3_6 FaceInfo

The structure *FaceInfo* contains the following information:
* Pave blocks that have state **In** for the face;
* Vertices that have state **In** for the face;
* Pave blocks that have state **On** for the face;
* Vertices that have state **On** for the face;
* Pave blocks built up from intersection curves for the face;
* Vertices built up from intersection points for the face.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image016.svg,"Face Info",420}

In the figure, for face *F1*:
* Pave blocks that have state **In** for the face: *PB<sub>in1</sub>*.
* Vertices that have state **In** for the face: *V<sub>in1</sub>*.
* Pave blocks that have state **On** for the face: *PB<sub>on11</sub>*,  *PB<sub>on12</sub>*, *PB<sub>on2</sub>*, *PB<sub>on31</sub>*, *PB<sub>on32</sub>*, *PB<sub>on4</sub>*.
* Vertices that have state **On** for the face: *V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6*.
* Pave blocks built up from intersection curves for the face: *PB<sub>sc1</sub>*.
* Vertices built up from intersection points for the face: none


@section specification__boolean_4 Data Structure

Data Structure (DS) is used to:
* Store information about input data and intermediate results;
* Provide the access to the information;
* Provide the links between the chunks of information.

This information includes:
* Arguments;
* Shapes;
* Interferences;
* Pave Blocks;
* Common Blocks.

Data Structure is implemented in the class *BOPDS_DS*.

@subsection specification__boolean_4_1	Arguments

The arguments are shapes (in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*):
* Number of arguments is unlimited.
* Each argument is a valid shape (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*).
* Each argument can be of one of the following types (see the Table):

| No	| Type	| Index of Type |
| :----- | :----- | :----- |

| 8	| VERTEX | 7 | 

* The argument of type *0 (COMPOUND)* can include any number of shapes of an arbitrary type (0, 1â€¦7).
* The argument should not be self-interfered, i.e. all sub-shapes of the argument that have geometrical coincidence through any topological entities (vertices, edges, faces) must share these entities.
* There are no restrictions on the type of underlying geometry of the shapes. The faces or edges of arguments *S<sub>i</sub>* can have underlying geometry of any type supported by Open CASCADE Technology modeling algorithms (in terms of *GeomAbs_CurveType* and *GeomAbs_SurfaceType*). 
* The faces or edges of the arguments should have underlying geometry with continuity that is not less than C1.

* Provide history information (in terms of <i>\::Generated(), \::Modified()</i> and <i>\::IsDeleted()</i>)
BP uses the DS prepared by *BOPAlgo_PaveFiller* described at chapter 5 as input data.
BP is implemented in the following classes:
* *BOPAlgo_Builder* -- for the General Fuse operator  (GFA).
* *BOPAlgo_BOP* -- for the Boolean Operation operator   (BOA).
* *BOPAlgo_Section* -- for the Section operator  (SA).
* *BOPAlgo_MakerVolume* -- for the Volume Maker operator.
* *BOPAlgo_Splitter* -- for the Splitter operator.
* *BOPAlgo_CellsBuilder* -- for the Cells Builder operator.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image020.png,"Diagram for BP classes",300}

The class *BOPAlgo_BuilderShape* provides the interface for algorithms that have:
* A Shape as the result;
* History information (in terms of <i>\::Generated(), \::Modified()</i> and <i>\::IsDeleted()).</i>

@section specification__boolean_7	General Fuse Algorithm
@subsection specification__boolean_7_1	Arguments
The arguments of the algorithm are shapes (in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*). The main requirements for the arguments are described in @ref specification__boolean_4 "Data Structure" chapter.

@subsection specification__boolean_7_2	Results

During the operation argument *Si* can be split into several parts *Si1, Si2â€¦ Si1NbSp*, where *NbSp* is the number of parts. The set <i>(Si1, Si2â€¦ Si1NbSp)</i> is an image of argument *Si*.
* The result of the General Fuse operation is a compound. Each sub-shape of the compound corresponds to the certain argument shape S1, S2â€¦Sn and has shared sub-shapes in accordance with interferences between the arguments.
* For the arguments of the type EDGE, FACE, SOLID the result contains split parts of the argument.
* For the arguments of the type WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID, COMPOUND the result contains the image of the shape of the corresponding type (i.e. WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID or COMPOUND).
The types of resulting shapes depend on the type of the corresponding argument participating in the operation. See the table below:

| No | Type of argument | Type of resulting shape | Comments |
| :--- | :---- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | COMPOUND | COMPOUND | The resulting COMPOUND is built from images of sub-shapes of type COMPOUND COMPSOLID, SHELL, WIRE and VERTEX. Sets of split sub-shapes of type SOLID, FACE, EDGE. | 
| 2	| COMPSOLID	| COMPSOLID	| The resulting COMPSOLID is built from split SOLIDs. |
| 3	| SOLID | Set of split SOLIDs | |
| 4	| SHELL | SHELL | The resulting SHELL is built from split FACEs |
| 5	| FACE	| Set of split FACEs | |
| 6	| WIRE | WIRE | The resulting WIRE is built from split EDGEs |
| 7	| EDGE	| Set of split EDGEs	| |
| 8	| VERTEX | VERTEX | |

@subsection specification__boolean_7_3a Options

The General Fuse algorithm has a set of options, which allow speeding-up the operation and improving the quality of the result:
* Parallel processing option allows running the algorithm in parallel mode;
* Fuzzy option allows setting the additional tolerance for the operation;
* Safe input shapes option allows preventing modification of the input shapes;
* Gluing option allows speeding-up the intersection of the arguments;
* Possibility to disable the check for the inverted solids among input shapes;
* Usage of Oriented Bounding Boxes in the operation;
* History support.

For more detailed information on these options, see the @ref specification__boolean_11a "Advanced options" section.

@section specification__boolean_8  Splitter Algorithm

The Splitter algorithm allows splitting a group of arbitrary shapes by another group of arbitrary shapes.<br>
It is based on the General Fuse  algorithm, thus all options of the General Fuse (see @ref specification__boolean_7_3a "GF Options") are also available in this algorithm.

@subsection specification__boolean_8_1 Arguments

* The arguments of the Splitter algorithm are divided into two groups - *Objects* (shapes that will be split) and *Tools* (shapes, by which the *Objects* will be split);
* The requirements for the arguments (both for *Objects* and *Tools*) are the same as for the General Fuse algorithm - there can be any number of arguments of any type in each group, but each argument should be valid and not self-interfered.

@subsection specification__boolean_8_2 Results

* The result of Splitter algorithm contains only the split parts of the shapes included into the group of *Objects*;
* The split parts of the shapes included only into the group of *Tools* are excluded from the result;
* If there are no shapes in the group of *Tools* the result of the operation will be equivalent to the result of General Fuse operation;
* The shapes can be split by other shapes from the same group (if these shapes are interfering).

@subsection specification__boolean_8_3 Usage

@subsubsection specification__boolean_8_3_1 API

On the low level the Splitter algorithm is implemented in class *BOPAlgo_Splitter*. The usage of this algorithm looks as follows:
~~~~{.cpp}
BOPAlgo_Splitter aSplitter;
// Setting arguments and tools
TopTools_ListOfShape aLSObjects = â€¦; // Objects
TopTools_ListOfShape aLSTools = â€¦; // Tools
aSplitter.SetArguments(aLSObjects);
aSplitter.SetTools(aLSTools);

// Set options for the algorithm
// setting options for this algorithm is similar to setting options for GF algorithm (see "GF Usage" chapter)
...

// Perform the operation
aSplitter.Perform();
if (aSplitter.HasErrors()) { //check error status
  return;
}
//
const TopoDS_Shape& aResult = aSplitter.Shape(); // result of the operation
~~~~

@subsubsection specification__boolean_8_3_2 DRAW

The command *bsplit* implements the Splitter algorithm in DRAW. Similarly to the *bbuild* command for the General Fuse algorithm, the *bsplit* command should be used after the Pave Filler is filled.

@section specification__boolean_9	Boolean Operations Algorithm

@subsection specification__boolean_9_1	Arguments

* The arguments of BOA are shapes in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*. The main requirements for the arguments are described in the @ref specification__boolean_4 "Data Structure"
* There are two groups of arguments in BOA:
	* Objects <i>(S1=S11, S12, ...)</i>;
	* Tools <i>(S2=S21, S22, ...)</i>.
* The following table contains the values of dimension for different types of arguments:

| No | Type of Argument	| Index of Type | Dimension |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :---- |
| 1 | COMPOUND | 0 | One of 0, 1, 2, 3 |
| 2	| COMPSOLID	| 1	| 3 |
| 3	| SOLID	| 2	| 3 |
| 4	| SHELL	| 3	| 2 |
| 5	| FACE | 4 | 2 |
| 6	| WIRE | 5 | 1 |
| 7 | EDGE | 6 | 1 |
| 8 | VERTEX | 7 | 0 |

* For Boolean operation Fuse all arguments should have equal dimensions.
* For Boolean operation Cut the minimal dimension of *S2* should not be less than the maximal dimension of *S1*.
* For Boolean operation Common the arguments can have any dimension.

@subsection specification__boolean_9_3	Results. General Rules

* The result of the Boolean operation is a compound (if defined). Each sub-shape of the compound has shared sub-shapes in accordance with interferences between the arguments. 
* The content of the result depends on the type of the operation (Common, Fuse, Cut12, Cut21) and the dimensions of the arguments. 
* The result of the operation Fuse is defined for arguments *S1* and *S2* that have the same dimension value : *Dim(S1)=Dim(S2)*. If the arguments have different dimension values the result of the operation Fuse is not defined. The dimension of the result is equal to the dimension of the arguments. For example, it is impossible to fuse an edge and a face.
* The result of the operation Fuse for arguments *S1* and *S2* contains the parts of arguments that have states **OUT** relative to the opposite arguments.
* The result of the operation Fuse for arguments *S1* and *S2* having dimension value 3 (Solids) is refined by removing all possible internal faces to provide minimal number of solids.
* The result of the operation Common for arguments *S1* and *S2* is defined for all values of the dimensions of the arguments. The result can contain shapes of different dimensions, but the minimal dimension of the result will be equal to the minimal dimension of the arguments. For example, the result of the operation Common between edges cannot be a vertex. 
* The result of the operation Common for the arguments *S1* and *S2* contains the parts of the argument that have states **IN** and **ON** relative to the opposite argument.
* The result of the operation Cut is defined for arguments *S1* and *S2* that have values of dimensions *Dim(S2)* that should not be less than *Dim(S1)*. The result can contain shapes of different dimensions, but the minimal dimension of the result will be equal to the minimal dimension of the objects *Dim(S1)*. The result of the operation *Cut12* is not defined for other cases. For example, it is impossible to cut an edge from a solid, because a solid without an edge is not defined. 
* The result of the operation *Cut12* for arguments *S1* and *S2* contains the parts of argument *S1* that have state **OUT** relative to the opposite argument *S2*.
* The result of the operation *Cut21* for arguments *S1* and *S2* contains the parts of argument *S2* that have state **OUT** relative to the opposite argument *S1*.
* For the arguments of collection type (WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID) the type will be passed in the result. For example, the result of Common operation between Shell and Wire will be a compound containing Wire.
* For the arguments of collection type (WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID) containing overlapping parts the overlapping parts passed into result will be repeated for each container from the input shapes containing such parts. The containers completely included in other containers will be avoided in the result.
* For the arguments of collection type (WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID) the containers included into result will have the same orientation as the original containers from arguments. In case of duplication its orientation will be defined by the orientation of the first container in arguments. Each container included into result will have coherent orientation of its sub-shapes.
* The result of the operation Fuse for the arguments of collection type (WIRE, SHELL) will consist of the shapes of the same collection type. The overlapping parts (EDGES/FACES) will be shared among containers, but duplicating containers will be avoided in the result. For example, the result of Fuse operation between two fully coinciding wires will be one wire, but the result of Fuse operation between two partially coinciding wires will be two wires sharing coinciding edges.
* The result of the operation Fuse for the arguments of type COMPSOLID will consist of the compound containing COMPSOLIDs created from connexity blocks of fused solids.
* The result of the operation Common for the arguments of collection type (WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID) will consist of the unique containers containing the overlapping parts. For example, the result of Common operation between two fully overlapping wires will be one wire containing all splits of edges. The number of wires in the result of Common operation between two partially overlapping wires will be equal to the number of connexity blocks of overlapping edges.

@subsection specification__boolean_bop_on_opensolids Boolean operations on open solids

The Boolean operations on open solids are tricky enough that the standard approach of Boolean operations for building the result, based on the splits of solids does not work.
It happens because the algorithm for splitting solids (*BOPAlgo_BuilderSolid*) always tries to create the closed loops (shells) and make solids from them. But if the input solid is not closed, what can be expected from its splits?
For performing Boolean Operations on open solids another approach is used, which does not rely on the splits of the solids to be correct, but tries to select the splits of faces, which are necessary for the given type of operation.
The point here is that the type of Boolean operation clearly defines the states for the faces to be taken into result:
- For **COMMON** operation all the faces from the arguments located inside any solid of the opposite group must be taken;
- For **FUSE** operation all the faces from the arguments located outside of all solids of the opposite group must be taken;
- For **CUT** operation all the faces from the Objects located outside of all solids of the Tools and all faces from the Tools located inside any solid of the Objects must be taken;
- For **CUT21** operation all the faces from the Objects located inside any solid of the Tools and all faces from the Tools located outside of all solids of the Objects must be taken.
From the selected faces the result solids are built. Please note, that the result may contain as normal (closed) solids as the open ones.

Even with this approach, the correct result of Boolean operation on open solids cannot be always guaranteed.
This is explained by non-manifold nature of open solids: in some cases classification of a face depends on the point of the face chosen for classification.

@section specification__boolean_10b Volume Maker Algorithm

The Volume Maker algorithm has been designed for building the elementary volumes (solids) from a set of connected, intersecting, or nested shapes. The algorithm can also be useful for splitting solids into parts, or constructing new solid(s) from set of intersecting or connected faces or shells.
The algorithm creates only closed solids. In general case the result solids are non-manifold: fragments of the input shapes (wires, faces) located inside the solids are added as internal sub-shapes to these solids.
But the algorithm allows preventing the addition of the internal for solids parts into result. In this case the result solids will be manifold and not contain any internal parts. However, this option does not prevent from the occurrence of the internal edges or vertices in the faces.<br>
Non-closed faces, free wires etc. located outside of any solid are always excluded from the result.

The Volume Maker algorithm is implemented in the class BOPAlgo_MakerVolume. It is based on the General Fuse (GF) algorithm. All the options of the GF algorithm (see @ref specification__boolean_7_3a "GF Options") are also available in this algorithm.

The requirements for the arguments are the same as for the arguments of GF algorithm - they could be of any type, but each argument should be valid and not self-interfered.

The algorithm allows disabling the calculation of intersections among the arguments. In this case the algorithm will run much faster, but the user should guarantee that the arguments do not interfere with each other, otherwise the result will be invalid (e.g. contain unexpected parts) or empty.
This option is useful e.g. for building a solid from the faces of one shell or from the shapes that have already been intersected.

@section specification__boolean_10c_Cells Cells Builder algorithm

The Cells Builder algorithm is an extension of the General Fuse algorithm. The result of General Fuse algorithm contains all split parts of the arguments. The Cells Builder algorithm provides means to specify if any given split part of the arguments (referred to as Cell) can be taken or avoided in the result.

The possibility of selecting any Cell allows combining any possible result and gives the Cells Builder algorithm a very wide sphere of application - from building the result of any Boolean operation to building the result of any application-specific operation.

The algorithm builds Cells only once and then just reuses them for combining the result. This gives this algorithm the performance advantage over Boolean operations, which always rebuild the splits to obtain the desirable result.

Thus, the Cells Builder algorithm can be especially useful for simulating Boolean expressions, i.e. a sequence of Boolean operations on the same arguments. Instead of performing many Boolean operations it allows getting the final result in a single operation. The Cells Builder will also be beneficial to obtain the results of different Boolean operations on the same arguments - Cut and Common, for example.

The Cells Builder algorithm also provides the possibility to remove any internal boundaries between splits of the same type, i.e. to fuse any same-dimensional parts added into the result and to keep any other parts as separate. This possibility is implemented through the Cells material approach: to remove the boundary between two Cells, both Cells should be assigned with the same material ID. However, if the same material ID has been assigned to the Cells of different dimension, the removal of the internal boundaries for that material will not be performed. Currently, such case is considered a limitation for the algorithm.

The algorithm can also create containers from the connected Cells added into result - WIRES from Edges, SHELLS from Faces and COMPSOLIDS from Solids.

@subsection specification__boolean_10c_Cells_1 Usage

The algorithm has been implemented in the *BOPAlgo_CellsBuilder* class.

Cells Builder is based on the General Fuse algorithm. Thus all options of the General Fuse algorithm (see @ref specification__boolean_7_3a "GF Options") are also available in this algorithm.

The requirements for the input shapes are the same as for General Fuse - each argument should be valid in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer* and *BOPAlgo_ArgumentAnalyzer*.

The result of the algorithm is a compound containing the selected parts of the basic type (VERTEX, EDGE, FACE or SOLID). The default result is an empty compound. It is possible to add any Cell by using the methods *AddToRessult()* and *AddAllToResult()*. It is also possible to remove any part from the result by using methods *RemoveFromResult()* and *RemoveAllFromResult()*. The method *RemoveAllFromResult()* is also suitable for clearing the result.

The Cells that should be added/removed to/from the result are defined through the input shapes containing the parts that should be taken *(ShapesToTake)* and the ones containing parts that should be avoided (ShapesToAvoid).
To be taken into the result the part must be IN all shapes from *ShapesToTake* and OUT of all shapes from *ShapesToAvoid*.

To remove Internal boundaries, it is necessary to set the same material to the Cells, between which the boundaries should be removed, and call the method *RemoveInternalBoundaries()*.
The material should not be equal to 0, as this is the default material ID. The boundaries between Cells with this material ID will not be removed. The same Cell cannot be added with different materials.
It is also possible to remove the boundaries when the result is combined. To do this, it is necessary to set the material for parts (not equal to 0) and set the flag *bUpdate* to TRUE.
If the same material ID has been set for parts of different dimension, the removal of internal boundaries for this material will not be performed.

It is possible to create typed Containers from the parts added into result by using method *MakeContainers()*. The type of the containers will depend on the type of the input shapes: WIRES for EDGE, SHELLS for FACES and COMPSOLIDS for SOLIDS. The result will be a compound containing containers.

#### API usage
Here is the example of the algorithm use on the API level:
~~~~
BOPAlgo_CellsBuilder aCBuilder;
// Set the arguments
TopTools_ListOfShape aLS = â€¦; // arguments

// Set options for the algorithm
// setting options for this algorithm is similar to setting options for GF algorithm (see "GF Usage" chapter)
...

aCBuilder.Perform(); // build splits of all arguments (GF)
if (aCBuilder.HasErrors()) { // check error status
  return;
}
//
// collecting of the cells into result
const TopoDS_Shape& anEmptyRes = aCBuilder.Shape(); // empty result, as nothing has been added yet 
const TopoDS_Shape& anAllCells = aCBuilder.GetAllParts(); //all split parts 
//
TopTools_ListOfShape aLSToTake = ...; // parts of these arguments will be taken into result
TopTools_ListOfShape aLSToAvoid = ...; // parts of these arguments will not be taken into result
//
Standard_Integer iMaterial = 1; // defines the material for the cells
Standard_Boolean bUpdate = Standard_False; // defines whether to update the result right now or not
// adding to result
aCBuilder.AddToResult(aLSToTake, aLSToAvoid, iMaterial, bUpdate);
aCBuilder.RemoveInternalBoundaries(); // removing of the boundaries
TopoDS_Shape aResult = aCBuilder.Shape(); // the result
// removing from result
aCBuilder.AddAllToResult();
aCBuilder.RemoveFromResult(aLSToTake, aLSToAvoid);
aResult = aCBuilder.Shape(); // the result

@section specification__boolean_10	Algorithm Limitations 

The chapter describes the problems that are considered as Algorithm limitations. In most cases an Algorithm failure is caused by a combination of various factors, such as self-interfered arguments, inappropriate or ungrounded values of the argument tolerances, adverse mutual position of the arguments, tangency, etc.

A lot of failures of GFA algorithm can be caused by bugs in low-level algorithms: Intersection Algorithm, Projection Algorithm, Approximation Algorithm, Classification Algorithm, etc.
* The Intersection, Projection and Approximation Algorithms are mostly used at the Intersection step. Their bugs directly cause wrong section results (i.e. incorrect section edges, section points, missing section edges or micro edges). It is not possible to obtain a correct final result of the GFA if a section result is wrong.
* The Projection Algorithm is used at the Intersection step. The purpose of Projection Algorithm is to compute 2D curves on surfaces. Wrong results here lead to incorrect or missing faces in the final GFA result. 
* The Classification Algorithm is used at the Building step. The bugs in the Classification Algorithm lead to errors in selecting shape parts (edges, faces, solids) and ultimately to a wrong final GFA result.

The description below illustrates some known GFA limitations. It does not enumerate exhaustively all problems that can arise in practice. Please address cases of Algorithm failure to the OCCT Maintenance Service.


@subsection specification__boolean_10_1	Arguments

@subsubsection specification__boolean_10_1_1	Common requirements 

Each argument should be valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*), or conversely, if the argument is considered as non-valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*), it cannot be used as an argument of the algorithm.

The class *BRepCheck_Analyzer* is used to check the overall validity of a shape. In OCCT a Shape (or its sub-shapes) is considered valid if it meets certain criteria. If the shape is found as invalid, it can be fixed by tools from *ShapeAnalysis, ShapeUpgrade* and *ShapeFix* packages.

However, it is important to note that class *BRepCheck_Analyzer* is just a tool that can have its own problems; this means that due to a specific factor(s) this tool can sometimes provide a wrong result.

Let us consider the following example:

The Analyzer checks distances between couples of 3D check-points <i>(Pi, PSi)</i> of edge *E* on face *F*. Point *Pi* is obtained from the 3D curve (at the parameter *ti*) of the edge. *PSi* is obtained from 2D curve (at the parameter *ti*) of the edge on surface *S* of face *F*. To be valid the distance should be less than *Tol(E)* for all couples of check-points. The number of these check-points is a predefined value (e.g. 23). 

Let us consider the case when edge *E* is recognized valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*).

Further, after some operation, edge *E* is split into two edges *E1* and *E2*. Each split edge has the same 3D curve and 2D curve as the original edge *E*. 

Let us check *E1* (or E2). The Analyzer again checks the distances between the couples of check-points points <i>(Pi, PSi)</i>. The number of these check-points is the same constant value (23), but there is no guarantee that the distances will be less than *Tol(E)*, because the points chosen for *E1* are not the same as for *E*. 

Thus, if *E1* is recognized by the Analyzer as non-valid, edge *E*  should also be non-valid. However *E* has been recognized as valid. Thus the Analyzer gives a wrong result for *E*.

The fact that the argument is a valid shape (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*) is a necessary but insufficient requirement to produce a valid result of the Algorithms.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_10_1_3	Pure self-interference

The argument should not be self-interfered, i.e. all sub-shapes of the argument that have geometrical coincidence through any topological entities (vertices, edges, faces) should share these entities.

#### Example 1: Compound of two edges
The compound of two edges *E1* and *E2* is a self-interfered shape and cannot be used as the argument of the Algorithms.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image036.svg,"Compound of two edges",230}

#### Example 2: Self-interfered Edge
The edge *E* is a self-interfered shape and cannot be used as an argument of the Algorithms.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image037.svg,"Self-interfered Edge",140}
 
#### Example 3: Self-interfered Face
The face *F* is a self-interfered shape and cannot be used as an argument of the Algorithms.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image038.svg,"Self-interfered Face",230}
 
####	Example 4: Face of Revolution
The face *F* has been obtained by revolution of edge *E* around line *L*.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image039a.png,"Face of Revolution: Arguments",230}
@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image039b.png,"Face of Revolution: Result",230}

In spite of the fact that face *F* is valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*) it is a self-interfered shape and cannot be used as the argument of the Algorithms.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_10_1_4	Self-interferences due to tolerances
#### Example 1: Non-closed Edge

Let us consider edge *E* based on a non-closed circle. @figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image040.png,"Edge based on a non-closed circle",230}

The distance between the vertices of *E* is *D=0.69799*. The values of the tolerances *Tol(V1)=Tol(V2)=0.5*.
@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image041.png,"Distance and Tolerances",230}
 
In spite of the fact that the edge *E* is valid in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*, it is a self-interfered shape because its vertices are interfered. Thus, edge *E* cannot be used as an argument of the Algorithms.

#### Example 2: Solid containing an interfered vertex

Let us consider solid *S* containing vertex V. @figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image042.png,"Solid containing an interfered vertex",230}

The value of  tolerance Tol(V)= 50.000075982061.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image043.png,"Tolerance",230}

In spite of the fact that solid *S* is valid in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer* it is a self-interfered shape because vertex *V* is interfered with a lot of sub-shapes from *S* without any topological connection with them. Thus solid *S* cannot be used as an argument of the Algorithms.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_10_1_5 Parametric representation
The parameterization of some surfaces (cylinder, cone, surface of revolution) can be the cause of limitation.

####	Example 1: Cylindrical surface
The parameterization range for cylindrical surface is:

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image135.png,"",230}

The range of *U* coordinate is always restricted while the range of *V* coordinate is non-restricted.

Let us consider a cylinder-based *Face 1* with radii *R=3* and *H=6*. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image044.png,"Face 1",230}

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image045.png,"P-Curves for Face 1",230}

Let us also consider a cylinder-based *Face 2* with radii *R=3000* and *H=6000* (resulting from scaling Face 1 with scale factor *ScF=1000*). 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image046.png,"Face 2",230}

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image047.png,"P-Curves for Face 2",230}

Pay attention to the Zoom value of the Figures.

It is obvious that starting with some value of *ScF*, e.g. *ScF>1000000*, all sloped p-Curves on *Face 2*  will be almost vertical. At least, there will be no difference between the values of angles computed by standard C Run-Time Library functions, such as *double acos(double x)*. The loss of accuracy in computation of angles can cause failure of some BP sub-algorithms, such as building faces from a set of edges or building solids from a set of faces.


@subsubsection specification__boolean_10_1_6 Using tolerances of vertices to fix gaps

It is possible to create shapes that use sub-shapes of lower order to avoid gaps in the tolerance-based data model.

Let us consider the following example:

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image048.png,"Example",230}

* Face *F* has two edges *E1* and *E2* and two vertices, the base plane is <i>{0,0,0, 0,0,1}</i>;
* Edge *E1* is based on line <i>{0,0,0, 1,0,0}, Tol(E1) = 1.e-7; </i>
* Edge *E2* is based on line <i>{0,1,0, 1,0,0}, Tol(E2) = 1.e-7;</i>
* Vertex *V1*, point <i>{0,0.5,0}, Tol(V1) = 1;</i>
* Vertex *V2*, point <i>{10,0.5,0}, Tol(V2) = 1;</i>
* Face *F* is valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*).
 
The values of tolerances *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)* are big enough to fix the gaps between the ends of the edges, but the vertices *V1* and *V2* do not contain any information about the trajectories connecting the corresponding ends of the edges. Thus, the trajectories are undefined. This will cause failure of some sub-algorithms of BP. For example, the sub-algorithms for building faces from a set of edges use the information about all edges connected in a vertex. The situation when a vertex has several pairs of edges such as above will not be solved in a right way. 


@subsection specification__boolean_11_1	Intersection problems
@subsubsection specification__boolean_11_1_1 Pure intersections and common zones 

#### Example: Intersecting Edges

Let us consider the intersection between two edges:
* *E1* is based on a line: <i>{0,-10,0, 1,0,0}, Tol(E1)=2.</i>
* *E2* is based on a circle: <i>{0,0,0, 0,0,1}, R=10, Tol(E2)=2.</i>

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image049.png,"Intersecting Edges",320}

The result of pure intersection between *E1* and *E2* is vertex *Vx {0,-10,0}*.

The result of intersection taking into account tolerances is the common zone *CZ* (part of 3D-space where the distance between the curves is less than or equals to the sum of edge tolerances. 

The Intersection Part of Algorithms uses the result of pure intersection *Vx* instead of *CZ* for the following reasons: 
* The Algorithms do not produce Common Blocks between edges based on underlying curves of explicitly different type (e.g. Line / Circle). If the curves have different types, the rule of thumb is that the produced result is of type **vertex**. This rule does not work for non-analytic curves (Bezier, B-Spline) and their combinations with analytic curves.
* The algorithm of intersection between two surfaces *IntPatch_Intersection* does not compute *CZ* of the intersection between curves and points. So even if *CZ* were computed by Edge/Edge intersection algorithm, its result could not be treated by Face/Face intersection algorithm.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_11_2_2 Tolerances and inaccuracies

The following limitations result from modeling errors or inaccuracies.

#### Example: Intersection of planar faces

Let us consider two planar rectangular faces *F1* and *F2*.

The intersection curve between the planes is curve *C12*. The curve produces a new intersection edge *EC12*. The edge goes through vertices *V1* and *V2* thanks to big tolerance values of vertices *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)*. So, two straight edges *E12* and *EC12* go through two vertices, which is  impossible in this case.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image050.svg,"Intersecting Faces",320}


The problem cannot be solved in general, because the length of *E12* can be infinite and the values of *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)* theoretically can be infinite too.

In a particular case the problem can be solved in several ways:
* Reduce, if possible, the values of *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)* (refinement of *F1*).
* Analyze the value of *Tol(EC12)* and increase *Tol(EC12)* to get a common part between the edges *EC12* and *E12*. Then the common part will be rejected as there is an already existing edge *E12* for face *F1*.

It is easy to see that if *C12* is slightly above the tolerance spheres of *V1* and *V2* the problem does not appear. 

#### Example: Intersection of two edges

Let us consider two edges *E1* and *E2*, which have common vertices *V1* and *V2*. The edges *E1* and *E2* have 3D-curves *C1* and *C2. Tol(E1)=1.e<sup>-7</sup>, Tol(E2)=1.e<sup>-7</sup>.*

*C1* practically coincides in 3D with *C2*. The value of deflection is *Dmax* (e.g. *Dmax=1.e<sup>-6</sup>*). 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image051.svg,"Intersecting Edges",420}

The evident and prospective result should be the Common Block between *E1* and *E2*. However, the result of intersection differs. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image052.svg,"Result of Intersection",420}

The result contains three new vertices *Vx1, Vx2* and *Vx3*, 8 new edges <i>(V1, Vx1, Vx2, Vx3, V2)</i> and no Common Blocks. This is correct due to the source data: *Tol(E1)=1.e<sup>-7</sup>, Tol(E2)=1.e<sup>-7</sup>* and <i>Dmax=1.e<sup>-6</sup></i>.

In this particular case the problem can be solved by several ways:
* Increase, if possible, the values *Tol(E1)* and *Tol(E2)* to get coincidence in 3D between *E1* and *E2* in terms of tolerance.
* Replace *E1* by a more accurate model.

The example can be extended from 1D (edges) to 2D (faces).

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image053.svg,"Intersecting Faces",420}

The comments and recommendations are the same as for 1D case above.


@subsubsection specification__boolean_11_2_3 Acquired Self-interferences
####	Example 1: Vertex and edge

Let us consider vertex *V1* and edge *E2*. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image054.svg,"Vertex and Edge",171}

Vertex *V1* interferes with vertices *V12* and *V22*.
So vertex *V21* should interfere with vertex *V22*, which is impossible because vertices *V21* and *V22* are the vertices of edge *E2*, thus *V21* is not equal to *V22*.

The problem cannot be solved in general, because the length can be as small as possible to provide validity of *E2* (in the extreme case: *Length (E2) = Tol(V21) + Tol(V22) + e,* where *e-> 0*).

In a particular case the problem can be solved by refinement of arguments, i.e. by decreasing the values of *Tol(V21)*, *Tol(V22)* and  *Tol(V1)*.

#### Example 2: Vertex and wire
  
Let us consider vertex *V2* and wire consisting of edges *E11* and *E12*. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image055.svg,"Vertex and Wire",200}

The arguments themselves are not self-intersected.
Vertex *V2* interferes with edges *E11* and *E12*. Thus, edge *E11* should interfere with edge *E22*, but it is impossible because edges *E11* and *E12* cannot interfere by the condition.
 
The cases when a non-self-interfered argument (or its sub-shapes) become interfered due to the intersections with other arguments (or their sub-shapes) are considered as limitations for the Algorithms.

@section specification__boolean_11a Advanced Options

The previous chapters describe so called Basic Operations. Most of tasks can be solved using Basic Operations. Nonetheless, there are cases that can not be solved straightforwardly by Basic Operations. The tasks are considered as limitations of Basic Operations. 

The chapter is devoted to Advanced Options. In some cases the usage of Advanced Options allows overcoming the limitations, improving the quality of the result of operations, robustness and performance of the operators themselves.

@subsection specification__boolean_11a_1  Fuzzy Boolean Operation

Fuzzy Boolean operation is the option of Basic Operations such as General Fuse, Splitting, Boolean, Section, Maker Volume and Cells building operations, in which additional user-specified tolerance is used. This option allows operators to handle robustly cases of touching and near-coincident, misaligned entities of the arguments.

The Fuzzy option is useful on the shapes with gaps or embeddings between the entities of these shapes, which are not covered by the tolerance values of these entities. Such shapes can be the result of modeling mistakes, or translating process, or import from other systems with loss of precision, or errors in some algorithms. 

Most likely, the Basic Operations will give unsatisfactory results on such models. The result may contain unexpected and unwanted small entities, faulty entities (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*), or there can be no result at all.

With the Fuzzy option it is possible to get the expected result -- it is just necessary to define the appropriate value of fuzzy tolerance for the operation. To define that value it is necessary to measure the value of the gap (or the value of embedding depth) between the entities of the models, slightly increase it (to make the shifted entities coincident in terms of their tolerance plus the additional one) and pass it to the algorithm.

Fuzzy option is included in interface of Intersection Part (class *BOPAlgo_PaveFiller*) and application programming interface (class  *BRepAlgoAPI_BooleanOperation*)

@subsubsection specification__boolean_11a_1_1 Examples
The following examples demonstrate the advantages of usage Fuzzy option operations over the Basic Operations in typical situations.

#### Case 1

In this example the cylinder (shown in yellow and transparent) is subtracted from the box (shown in red). The cylinder is shifted by  5e<sup>-5</sup> relatively to the box along its axis (the distance between rear faces of the box and cylinder is 5e<sup>-5</sup>).

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image121.png,"",240}
  
The following results are obtained using Basic Operations and the Fuzzy ones with the fuzzy value 5e<sup>-5</sup>:

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image122.png,"Result of CUT operation obtained with Basic Operations",240}

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image123.png,"Result of CUT operation obtained with Fuzzy Option",240}

In this example Fuzzy option allows eliminating a very thin part of the result shape produced by Basic algorithm due to misalignment of rear faces of the box and the cylinder. 

#### Case 2

In this example two boxes are fused. One of them has dimensions 10*10*10, and the other is 10*10.000001*10.000001 and adjacent to the first one. There is no gap in this case as the surfaces of the neighboring faces coincide, but one box is slightly greater than the other. 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image124.png,"",240}

The following results are obtained using Basic Operations and the Fuzzy ones with the fuzzy value 1e<sup>-6</sup>: 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image125.png,"Result of CUT operation obtained with Basic Operations",240}

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image126.png,"Result of CUT operation obtained with Fuzzy Option",240}

In this example Fuzzy option allows eliminating an extremely narrow face in the result produced by Basic operation.

#### Case 3

In this example the small planar face (shown in orange) is subtracted from the big one (shown in yellow). There is a gap 1e<sup>-5</sup> between the edges of these faces.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image127.png,"",240}

The following results are obtained using Basic Operations and the Fuzzy ones with the fuzzy value 1e<sup>-5</sup>: 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image128.png,"Result of CUT operation obtained with Basic Operations",240}

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image129.png,"Result of CUT operation obtained with Fuzzy Option",240}

In this example Fuzzy options eliminated a pin-like protrusion resulting from the gap between edges of the argument faces.

#### Case 4

In this example the small edge is subtracted from the big one. The edges are overlapping not precisely, with max deviation between them equal to 5.28004e<sup>-5</sup>. We will use 6e<sup>-5</sup> value for Fuzzy option.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image130.png,"",240}

The following results are obtained using Basic Operations and the Fuzzy ones with the fuzzy value 6e<sup>-5</sup>: 

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image131.png,"Result of CUT operation obtained with Basic Operations",240}

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image132.png,"Result of CUT operation obtained with Fuzzy Option",240}

This example stresses not only the validity, but also the performance issue. The usage of Fuzzy option with the appropriate value allows processing the case much faster than with the pure Basic operation. The performance gain for the case is 45 (Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3450 CPU @ 3.10 GHz).

@subsection specification__boolean_11a_2 Gluing Operation

The Gluing operation is the option of the Basic Operations such as General Fuse, Splitting, Boolean, Section, Maker Volume and Cells building operations.
It has been designed to speed up the computation of the interferences among arguments of the operations on special cases, in which the arguments may be overlapping but do not have real intersections between their sub-shapes.

This option cannot be used on the shapes having real intersections, like intersection vertex between edges, or intersection vertex between edge and a face or intersection line between faces:

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/glue_options_image002.png,"Intersecting faces",240}

There are two possibilities of overlapping shapes:
* The shapes can be partially coinciding - the faces do not have intersection curves, but overlapping. The faces of such arguments will be split during the operation. The following picture illustrates such shapes:

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/glue_options_image001.png,"Partially coinciding faces",240}

* The shapes can be fully coinciding - there should be no partial overlapping of the faces, thus no intersection of type EDGE/FACE at all. In such cases the faces will not be split during the operation.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/glue_options_image003.png,"Full coinciding faces of the boxes",240}

Thus, there are two possible options - for full and partial coincidence of the shapes.

Even though there are no real intersections on such cases without Gluing options the algorithm will still intersect the sub-shapes of the arguments with interfering bounding boxes.

The performance improvement in gluing mode is achieved by excluding the most time consuming computations and in some case can go up to 90%:
* Exclude computation of FACE/FACE intersections for partial coincidence;
* Exclude computation of VERTEX/FACE, EDGE/FACE and FACE/FACE intersections for full coincidence.

By setting the Gluing option for the operation user should guarantee that the arguments are really coinciding. The algorithm does not check this itself. Setting inappropriate option for the operation is likely to lead to incorrect result.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_11a_2_1 Usage

The Gluing option is an enumeration implemented in BOPAlgo_GlueEnum.hxx:
* BOPAlgo_GlueOff - default value for the algorithms, Gluing is switched off;
* BOPAlgo_GlueShift - Glue option for shapes with partial coincidence;
* BOPAlgo_GlueFull - Glue option for shapes with full coincidence.

#### API level
For setting the Gluing options for the algorithm it is just necessary to call the SetGlue(const BOPAlgo_Glue) method with appropriate value:
~~~~
BOPAlgo_Builder aGF;
//
....
// setting the gluing option to speed up intersection of the arguments
aGF.SetGlue(BOPAlgo_GlueShift)
//
....
~~~~

#### TCL level
For setting the Gluing options in DRAW it is necessary to call the <i>bglue</i> command with appropriate value:
* 0 - default value, Gluing is off;
* 1 - for partial coincidence;
* 2 - for full coincidence

~~~~{.php}
bglue 1
~~~~

@subsubsection specification__boolean_11a_2_2 Examples
#### Case1 - Fusing the 64 bspline boxes into one solid

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/glue_options_image004.png,"BSpline Boxes with partial coincidence",240}

Performance improvement from using the GlueShift option in this case is about 70 percent.

#### Case2 - Sewing faces of the shape after reading from IGES

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/glue_options_image005.png,"Faces with coinciding but not shared edges",240}

Performance improvement in this case is also about 70 percent.

@subsection specification__boolean_11a_3 Safe processing mode

The safe processing mode is the advanced option in Boolean Operation component. This mode can be applied to all Basic operations such as General Fuse, Splitting, Boolean, Section, Maker Volume, Cells building.
This option allows keeping the input arguments untouched. In other words, switching this option on prevents the input arguments from any modification such as tolerance increase, addition of the P-Curves on edges, etc.

The option can be very useful for implementation of the Undo/Redo mechanism in the applications and allows performing the operation many times without changing the inputs.

By default the safe processing option is switched off for the algorithms. Enabling this option might slightly decrease the performance of the operation, because instead of the modification of some entity it will be necessary to create the copy of this entity and modify it. However, this degradation should be very small because the copying is performed only in case of necessity.

The option is also available in the Intersection algorithm - *BOPAlgo_PaveFiller*. To perform several different operations on the same arguments, the safe processing mode can be enabled in PaveFiller, prepared only once and then used in operations. It is enough to set this option to PaveFiller only and all algorithms taking this PaveFiller will also work in the safe mode.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_11a_3_1 Usage

#### API level

To enable/disable the safe processing mode for the algorithm, it is necessary to call *SetNonDestructive()* method with the  appropriate value:
~~~~
BOPAlgo_Builder aGF;
//
....
// enabling the safe processing mode to prevent modification of the input shapes
aGF.SetNonDestructive(Standard_True);
//
....
~~~~

#### TCL level
To enable the safe processing mode for the operation in DRAW, it is necessary to call the <i>bnondestructive</i> command with the appropriate value:
* 0 - default value, the safe mode is switched off;
* 1 - the safe mode will be switched on.

~~~~{.php}
bnondestructive 1
~~~~

@subsection specification__boolean_11a_4 How to disable check of input solids for inverted status

By default, all input solids are checked for inverted status, i.e. the solids are classified to understand if they are holes in the space (negative volumes) or normal solids (positive volumes). The possibility to disable the check of the input solids for inverted status is the advanced option in Boolean Operation component. This option can be applied to all Basic operations, such as General Fuse, Splitting, Boolean, Section, Maker Volume and Cells building.
This option allows avoiding time-consuming classification of the input solids and processing them in the same way as positive volumes, saving up to 10 percent of time on the cases with a big number of input solids.

The classification should be disabled only if the user is sure that there are no negative volumes among the input solids, otherwise the result may be invalid.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_11a_4_1 Usage

#### API level

To enable/disable the classification of the input solids it is necessary to call *SetCheckInverted()* method with the appropriate value:
~~~~
BOPAlgo_Builder aGF;
//

// disabling the classification of the input solid
aGF.SetCheckInverted(Standard_False);
//
....
~~~~

#### TCL level
To enable/disable the classification of the solids in DRAW, it is necessary to call *bcheckinverted* command with the appropriate value:
* 0 - disabling the classification;
* 1 - default value, enabling the classification.

@subsection specification__boolean_11a_5_obb Usage of Oriented Bounding Boxes

Since Oriented Bounding Boxes are usually much tighter than Axes Aligned Bounding Boxes (for more information on OBB see the @ref occt_modat_6 "Bounding boxes" chapter of Modeling data User guide) its usage can significantly speed-up the intersection stage of the operation by reducing the number of interfering objects.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_11a_5_obb_1 Usage

@section specification__boolean_ers Errors and warnings reporting system

The chapter describes the Error/Warning reporting system of the algorithms in the Boolean Component.

The errors and warnings are collected in the instance of the class *Message_Report* maintained as a field by common base class of Boolean operation algorithms *BOPAlgo_Options*.

The error is reported in for problems which cannot be treated and cause the algorithm to fail. 
In this case the result of the operation will be incorrect or incomplete or there will be no result at all. 

The warnings are reported for the problems which can be potentially handled or ignored and thus do not cause the algorithms to stop their work (but probably affect the result). 

All possible errors and warnings that can be set by the algorithm are listed in its header file.
The complete list of errors and warnings that can be generated by Boolean operations is defined in *BOPAlgo_Alerts.hxx*.

Use method *HasErrors()* to check for presence of error; method *HasError()* can be used to check for particular error.
Methods *DumpErrors()* outputs textual description of collected errors into the stream.
Similar methods *HasWarnings()*, *HasWarning()*, and *DumpWarnings()* are provided for warnings.

Note that messages corresponding to errors and warnings are defined in resource file *BOPAlgo.msg*.
These messages can be localized; for that put translated version to separate file and load it in the application by call to *Message_MsgFile::Load()* .

Here is the example of how to use this system:
~~~~{.php}
BOPAlgo_PaveFiller aPF;
aPF.SetArguments(...);
aPF.Perform();
if (aPF.HasErrors()) {
  aPF.DumpErrors(std::cerr);
  //
  if (aPF.HasError(STANDARD_TYPE(BOPAlgo_AlertNullInputShapes)) {
    // some actions
  }
  if (aPF.HasWarning(STANDARD_TYPE(BOPAlgo_AlertTooSmallEdge)) {
    // some actions
  }
  ...
}
~~~~

DRAW commands executing Boolean operations output errors and warnings generated by these operations in textual form.
Additional option allows saving shapes for which warnings have been generated, as DRAW variables. 
To activate this option, run command *bdrawwarnshapes* with argument 1 (or with 0 to deactivate):
~~~~{.php}
bdrawwarnshapes 1
~~~~

After setting this option and running an algorithm the result will look as follows:
~~~~
Warning: The interfering vertices of the same argument: ws_1_1 ws_1_2
Warning: The positioning of the shapes leads to creation of small edges without valid range: ws_2_1

@section specification__boolean_history History Information

All operations in Boolean Component support @ref occt_modalg_hist "History information". This chapter describes how the History is filled for these operations.

Additionally to Vertices, Edges and Faces the history is also available for the Solids.

The rules for filling the History information about Deleted and Modified shapes are the same as for the API algorithms.

Only the rules for Generated shapes require clarification.
In terms of the algorithms in Boolean Component the shape from the arguments can have Generated shapes only if these new shapes 
have been obtained as a result of pure intersection (not overlapping) of this shape with any other shapes from arguments. Thus, the Generated shapes are always:
* VERTICES created from the intersection points and may be Generated from edges and faces only;
* EDGES created from the intersection edges and may be Generated from faces only.

So, only EDGES and FACES could have information about Generated shapes. For all other types of shapes the list of Generated shapes will be empty.

@subsection specification__boolean_history_ex Examples

Here are some examples illustrating the History information.

@subsubsection specification__boolean_history_ex_del Deleted shapes

The result of CUT operation of two overlapping planar faces (see the example below) does not contain any parts from the tool face. Thus, the tool face is considered as Deleted.
If the faces are not fully coinciding, the result must contain some parts of the object face. In this case object face will be considered as not deleted.
But if the faces are fully coinciding, the result must be empty, and both faces will be considered as Deleted.

Example of the overlapping faces:

~~~~{.php}
plane p 0 0 0 0 0 1
mkface f1 p -10 10 -10 10
mkface f2 p 0 20 -10 10

bclearobjects
bcleartools
baddobjects f1
baddtools f2
bfillds
bbop r 2

savehistory cut_hist
isdeleted cut_hist f1
# Not deleted

isdeleted cut_hist f2
# Deleted
~~~~

@subsubsection specification__boolean_history_ex_modif Modified shapes

In the FUSE operation of two edges intersecting in one point (see the example below), both edges will be split by the intersection point. All these splits will be contained in the result.
Thus, each of the input edges will be Modified into its two splits.
But in the CUT operation on the same edges, the tool edge will be Deleted from the result and, thus, will not have any Modified shapes.

Example of the intersecting edges:
~~~~{.php}
line l1 0 0 0 1 0 0
mkedge e1 l1 -10 10

line l2 0 0 0 0 1 0
mkedge e2 l2 -10 10

@subsubsection specification__boolean_history_gen Generated shapes

Two intersecting edges will both have the intersection vertices Generated from them.

As for the operation with intersecting faces, consider the following example:

~~~~{.php}
plane p1 0 0 0 0 0 1
mkface f1 p1 -10 10 -10 10

plane p2 0 0 0 1 0 0

# EDGES: 1


# common operation - result is empty
bbop r 0

savehistory com_hist

generated gf1 com_hist f1
# No shapes were generated from the shape

generated gf2 com_hist f2
# No shapes were generated from the shape

~~~~

@section specification__boolean_simplification BOP result simplification

The API algorithms implementing Boolean Operations provide possibility to simplify the result shape by unification of the connected tangential edges and faces.
This simplification is performed by the method *SimplifyResult* which is implemented in the class *BRepAlgoAPI_BuilderAlgo* (General Fuse operation).
It makes it available for users of the classes *BRepAlgoAPI_BooleanOperation* (all Boolean Operations) and *BRepAlgoAPI_Splitter* (split operation).

The simplification is performed by the means of *ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDom* algorithm. The result of operation is overwritten with the simplified result.

The simplification is performed without creation of the Internal shapes, i.e. shapes connections will never be broken. It is performed on the whole result shape.
Thus, if the input shapes contained connected tangent edges or faces unmodified during the operation they will also be unified.

History of the simplification is merged into the main history of operation, thus it will be accounted when asking for Modified, Generated and Deleted shapes.

Some options of the main operation are passed into the Unifier:
- Fuzzy tolerance of the operation is given to the Unifier as the linear tolerance.
- Non destructive mode here controls the safe input mode in Unifier.

For controlling this possibility in DRAW the command **bsimplify** has been implemented. See the @ref occt_draw_bop_options "Boolean Operations options" chapter in draw user guide.


@subsection specification__boolean_simplification_examples Examples

Here is the simple example of simplification of the result of Fuse operation of two boxes:

~~~~{.php}

@section specification__boolean_11b Usage 

The chapter contains some examples of the OCCT Boolean Component usage. The usage is possible on two levels: C++ and Tcl. 

@subsection specification__boolean_11b_1 Package BRepAlgoAPI

The package *BRepAlgoAPI* provides the Application Programming Interface of the Boolean Component.

The package consists of the following classes:
* *BRepAlgoAPI_Algo* -- the root class that provides the interface for algorithms. 
* *BRepAlgoAPI_BuilderAlgo* -- the class API level of General Fuse algorithm.
* *BRepAlgoAPI_Splitter* -- the class API level of the Splitter algorithm.
* *BRepAlgoAPI_BooleanOperation* -- the root class for the classes *BRepAlgoAPI_Fuse*. *BRepAlgoAPI_Common*, *BRepAlgoAPI_Cut* and *BRepAlgoAPI_Section*.
* *BRepAlgoAPI_Fuse* -- the class provides Boolean fusion operation. 
* *BRepAlgoAPI_Common* -- the class provides Boolean common operation.
* *BRepAlgoAPI_Cut* -- the class provides Boolean cut operation.
* *BRepAlgoAPI_Section* -- the class provides Boolean section operation.

@figure{/specification/boolean_operations/images/operations_image065.png,"Diagram of BRepAlgoAPI package",420}

The detailed description of the classes can be found in the corresponding .hxx files. The examples are below in this chapter.

@subsection specification__boolean_11b_2 Package BOPTest
The package *BOPTest* provides the usage of the Boolean Component on Tcl level. The method *BOPTest::APICommands* contains corresponding Tcl commands: 

* *bapibuild* -- for General Fuse Operator;
* *bapisplit* -- for Splitter Operator;
* *bapibop* -- for Boolean Operator and Section Operator.
