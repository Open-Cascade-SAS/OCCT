# This workflow builds and tests OCCT on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux with Clang, and Linux with GCC).
# It is triggered on pull requests to any branch.
# The workflow includes steps to prepare and build the project on each platform, run tests, and upload the results.
# Concurrency is set to ensure that only one instance of the workflow runs per pull request at a time.
